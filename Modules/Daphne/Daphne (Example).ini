# pauseOnExit -  If true, will pause Daphne before exiting by sending "P". If your monitor is not the same resolution as daphne, Fade_Out will not display correctly. Pausing Daphne tries to prevent this.
# -noissues is for Esh's Aurunmilla. It stops daphne's warning about issues at launch.
# -fastboot is for Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, It skips the self test in the beginning.
