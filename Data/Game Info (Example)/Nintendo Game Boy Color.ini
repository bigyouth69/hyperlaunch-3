Description=The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.<br><br>The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.

Their goal is to find Obelix's lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.<br><br>This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the "Instant Fun" option. They vary from a "Memory" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as "Throw a Roman Mini Game".<br><br>Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).

While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, "that'll do, pig."

In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.<br><br>Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must clear.

Description=Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).<br><br>At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.<br><br>Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

While you control a party, combat is strictly one-on-one, as the game attempts to join the Pokémon craze with "dueling" combat between individual monsters. Additionally, you can capture and train the monsters you defeat, and even upgrade them or merge them with other creatures to obtain additional powers. The game can also connect with the similarly-themed Mononoke Sugoroku for the N64, in order to transfer and exchange monsters between both titles.

Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.<br><br>The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the <br>big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.<br><br>Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.<br><br>The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.

Description=Hanasaka Tenshi Tentenkun no Beat Breaker is a hybrid of the game Simon and a match-3 puzzle game.  Four buttons are required to play - left and right on the Control Pad, and the A and B buttons.  The game screen is split in half.  The top half contains eight columns, followed by a striped line, and then an empty white area.  To the left of the game screen is the time bar.  As you complete rounds, the bar increases.  When the bar reaches the top of the clock, the level is complete.  If your white area fills up beyond the striped lines, the game is over.<br><br>Each round has eight notes played in a specific rhythm.  After they are played, they play again, and this time, after each note is played, circles fall down the columns.  Your goal is to press a button when the circles hit the striped line, which turns them into colored circles with either arrows, A or B on them.  These then land in the bin.  If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn into black angry face circles, which are more difficult to clear.  Perform enough beats correctly and happy face circles will appear - these act as wildcards.<br><br>When three or more colored circles line up horizontally, they clear from the screen and points are scored.  While you could complete levels by simply pressing the same button in time over and over, the other buttons can be used to set up combos, allowing for bigger points.  In addition, if you press a note incorrectly, sometimes a different button symbol will fall instead, which you must then strategically try to clear.

Hands of Time features an overhead view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives.

In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through "lecture attacks", using helpful hints like "Be Careful!" (which increases defense, for example).<br><br>Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added: the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed later. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.<br><br>Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu.

Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.<br><br>Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)<br><br>In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.

This is a shooter, which means that while there are cutscenes and plotlines happening in the background, most of it is window dressing for miles of action and gallons of blood and flayed flesh.

Description=The third title of the Lufia series gives us an entirely new battle and dungeon system. All of the dungeons in this game are randomly generated, which can get annoying at times. Otherwise, it's a lot like Lufia 2 in the dungeon department. You see the monsters, they move when you move and you can stun them.<br><br>The battle system in this game is rather unique. You can use 9 characters in a 3x3 formation. The character in the front row deals the most physical damage, but also takes the most physical damage. Vice versa for the back row one, and the one in the middle row obviously takes and deals average damage. 9 characters might seem like much to use, but you can only let 3 characters attack during a turn; One from each vertical row. <br><br>The 3x3 system is also used for special attacks and magic systems. Each character has a power in one colour; Blue, green, yellow or red, which means magic, defense, speed or power respectively. The other characters who are in the same vertical or horizontal row also receive the same amount of power from this character; This way, all characters share their power with eachother. <br><br>Other than that, the story circles around the Sinistrals returning - Again. Another thing that has returned is the Ancient Dungeon, but this time around, it has 200 floors and a very difficult and unexpected boss at the bottom...

Description=The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse's dog!  All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them.  Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race!  You'll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto!<br><br>Mickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey's Racing Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.<br><br>The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style.  You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you're given points based on your placing.  The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).<br><br>There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every race.  Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'.  In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving.  The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.<br><br>Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.  As you progress through the game, you'll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.

Description=6 Puzzle Games designed by Alexey Pajitnov, the original Tetris designer, on one Gameboy Color cartdridge.<br><br>Jewel Chase. A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.<br><br>Spring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.<br><br>Lineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.<br><br>Finty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.<br><br>Color Collison. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time.<br>The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.<br><br>Rat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.

Description=Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. <br><br>Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.<br><br>In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. <br><br>During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.

Features include exaggerated muscle-bound player models, "turbo" buttons, fast action, and some pretty wild rules changes (like 30 yards for a first down!). Blitz is nothing if not a unique football gaming experience.<br><br>Player taunts ("This is MY HOUSE!"), unpenalized late hits, and amusing running commentary from the announcers ("That was totally uncalled for -- but awfully fun to watch!") all add to the game's violent charm.

Description=Disguised behind a 50's style B-movie background story about an evil professor (trying to take over the world, of course) who turns the hero (you) into a shapeless 'blob', is an increasingly complex strategic puzzle game with a variety of different targets. Typical Mission goals would be centered around clearing the screen of all elements, but hitting certain targets on the way and making sure that there is still a route to the exit. If the player reaches the exit with all mission objectives complete, the next level is introduced by a password. Playtime per level is up to 20 minutes and there are 150 levels. The first 20 or so levels introduce all game elements one by one.<br><br>There are various extras, allowing to manipulate puzzle pieces, remove blocked routes and so on, as well as special blocks such as teleporters (beaming you around the playfield), or ice (making direction changes impossible) etc.<br><br>The basic principle is like memory, i.e. two equal looking puzzle pieces need to be found and are then taken of the playfield. To do that the player can 'clone' the blob, and send his alter ego to connect the blocks occupied by the main character and the clone.

You are a new commander of Hanagumi (you can name the hero the way you like), who arrives at the theater to work under the guidance of Ichirou Oogami, the main hero of the series, and to lead the beautiful girls Sakura, Sumire, Honglan and others into battle against demons.<br><br>The game is a mixture of adventure/"dating sim" and turn-based battles. The RPG element is also present, as the girls fight differently depending on how you treat them. Unlike in other Sakura Taisen games, the battles here are entirely menu-driven. Also, the main plot is unlinear, and you can reach one of the 14 available endings, which also include "bad" ones. You can even get thrown out of the theater for indecent behavior.

Description=In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.
