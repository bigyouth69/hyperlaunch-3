Each level plays themes from the games, remixed by popular Japanese chiptune band, YMCK.  The game is heavily themed around the original NES/Famicom era.<br><br>In Pictobits, both screens are used.  The top screen is initially blank, while the touch screen displays the playfield and any blocks (which are called 'bits').  You can pick up to eight bits by tapping them with the stylus.  You can then place them on any free place on the touch screen by letting go and tapping an empty area.  Larger pieces, called 'megabits', slowly fall down from the top of the screen.  These can be cleared by using bits of the same color to line up four or more horizontally or vertically, or make squares or rectangles.  If you're in trouble, you can use the "POW" power to clear some of the screen of bits, but you'll be able to pick up one less bit as a result.  As you clear megabits, the colors transfer to the top screen.  When you have enough of each color, you reveal the secret image, which is a sprite from a Nintendo game.<br><br>As you clear megabits, you'll earn coins.  Coins can be used to restore the amount of bits you can pick up as a result of using POW (each restore costs five coins).  Any remaining coins get added to your game total.  These coins can then be used to purchase music tracks, as well as more difficult "Dark" versions of the stages you have already cleared.

Description=Gameloft developed its own game to keep your intellectual muscles in shape, in the wake of the successful Nintendo Brain Game series. Training is based on four subjects: logic, math, memory and visual - with three games each. You can either take a daily brain test to play a game for each of the four subjects - less than 90 seconds per game - or first get acquainted with the gameplay mechanics in the training room. A female professor comments on your progress.<br><br>Each game has a timer, so you have to find the balance between accuracy and speed. Answering is done by moving a cursor between the possibilities and pressing a button. For each game, your overall progress is tracked in charts - either globally or for each subject. If you do well, new games are opened up in the practice room - with three difficulty levels -, and your overall brain percentage is raised, along with the levels of the individual subjects. That way, you get more difficult games for each subject based on your overall performance. For instance: if your memory is very lacking, but you are strong at maths, you can continue playing at a low memory level until it improves, while having difficult math games at the same time.<br><br>The following 12 mini-games are included:<br><br>1. Logic - Balanced: different scales and (piled) objects are shown. Determine the heaviest according to the scales.<br><br>2. Logic - Magic Rule: determine the logical rule applied to a figure based on two examples.<br><br>3. Logic - Impression: identify which impression a wheel would leave if rolled across a surface, starting from the bottom.<br><br>4. Math - Trout Route: a math operator is shown at the top of the screen. Create a trail in a grid of numbers according to the operator.<br><br>5. Math - Arithmetic: identify the operator or number needed to complete each equation.<br><br>6. Math - Tick Tock: calculate how much time has passed between the two clocks.<br><br>7.

The player has to survive numerous adventures, gather an army of mystical creatures and learn dark magic before he or she can face the ultimate enemy and save Elendior.<br><br>There are three different character classes available. Each class starts the game with a different magic spell. The hero travels through the land on a map and must fight numerous enemies along the way. Battles are fought by playing a trading card / board game against an AI opponent. Before the battle a deck of cards must be selected. Each card represents a creature and has for numbers corresponding to the fours sides of the card. These numbers symbolize the fighting strength of the creature in that direction. The two players take turns placing their cards on a 3x3 board. If a card is put next to a weaker card (i.e. the strength or the new "attacking" card is higher than the strength of the "defending" card on their common border) the weaker card changes to the color of the attacking player. The battle ends when 9 cards have been played; the player who owns most cards on the board wins. In addition to these basic rules there are several advanced rules such as cards and board squares associated with elements (hence the name of the game), different counting modes and magic spells you can use during the battle. The winner of a battle receives one or more of the opponents cards. An important aspect of the game is to win more and stronger cards and learn new magic spells.

Description=The goal of the action-/strategy-mix Flight Control is simple: land as many planes and helicopters as possible to get the highest score on the available airfields. But instead of controlling the aircraft directly, the player takes on the role of a flight control officer who has to guide the aircraft to the landing strip without them colliding with other aircraft in the air.<br><br>To do so, the player has to touch the aircraft he wants to guide and draw its flight path on the map. The aircraft will then follow that path until it is either told otherwise, successfully lands or crashes with another aircraft subsequently ending the game. To make things more difficult, each plane or helicopter has a color and needs to land on the landing strip associated with it. Some aircraft are also faster than other ones and sometimes an emergency landing happens with a plane incoming on a predefined path that can not be altered.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer-mode for two player in which the players have to land the aircraft associated to their screen and send the ones needed by the other player to his screen.

Description=Frenzic is a puzzle game based around six colored wheels around a central circle.  Colored "pie slices" will appear in the middle circle and need to be moved to one of the outer circles.  Completing a circle clears it and earns the player points.  However, filling a circle with more "slices" of one color earns more points, and filling a circle completely with one color earns an extra life.<br><br>The catch to the gameplay is that the pie slices cannot be rotated when moved from the center circle.  Should a purple wedge appear in the "12 o'clock" position, it must be moved to a circle with an opening in it's "12 o'clock" position.  Should the player gamble on filling all slots, and have the same location filled in each of the six circles, they do have a buffer with where a "spare" piece may be stored.  But should a piece appear in the center that cannot be placed in any circle or the buffer spot, a life is lost.<br><br>There is only one gameplay mode, and the game is for one player.  For the DSiWare version of the game, gameplay is performed with the stylus on the bottom, touch-screen, of the DSi.  The top screen shows score and other information.

Kuru Kuru Action Kuru Pachi 6 is a puzzle game from the Game Boy Advance title Nonono Puzzle Chairian.  The rules are simple - you control a 2x2 cursor that can rotate the balls on a grid clockwise, or counterclockwise.  Your job is to line up like numbered balls horizontally or vertically.  Lining up three or more "3"s turns them all into "4"s, lining up four or more "4"s, turns them into "5"s, and so on, up until "6"s.  When you line up six or more "6"s, they all disappear from the grid entirely.<br><br>The trick to the game is that while other lined up numbers are changing, you can still move the cursor around and rotate other numbers.  This means that while one set of numbers is changing, you can prepare others to change as well.  If you're quick and skilled enough, you can set off continuous combos.<br><br>Kuru Kuru Action Kuru Pachi 6 features four different modes of play:<br><br> Puzzle - In this mode, you must solve puzzles with a set amount of moves.<br> Time Attack - In this mode, you must clear a set amount of balls before time runs out.<br> Score Attack - In this mode, clearing balls adds to a meter, which allows you to continue playing.  When the meter completely drains, it's game over.<br> Chain Challenge - In this mode, you must keep a chain going continuously.  When your chain stops, the game is over.

In addition the wind decides too where the player's ball lands.<br><br>As opposed to real life though, the player can influence the ball's flightpath during the flight by choosing in which direction it spins.

Description=Photo Dojo is a 2-D fighting game developed by Nintendo. It's main point is to create a fighter by putting yourself in the game, literally. Creating a character is accomplished using the Nintendo DSi camera. Your character is created by taking 13 pictures of either yourself or your friend in different prearranged fighting poses ranging from jumping to throwing a fireball. A fighter is not complete without his or her own sound effects, and this is where your DSi microphone comes into play, letting you record different dialogue such as your punching noises to your victory speech. The stages in which you fight on are also your own, and can be taken using the DSi camera.<br><br>After creating a fighter you are able to play one of two modes in the game. The first is Vs. mode, where you can battle with your own character against a friend also using his own character. Two player fighting with a friend is limited to using one Nintendo DSi, so player one will use the L-Shoulder and Directional Pad and player 2 will use the R-Shoulder and face buttons. The next mode is called Story mode and it's main premise is to take one of your created characters and face off against a wave of 100 of your other created characters. Beating all 100 characters in Story Mode will unlock a new game track which you can use when starting up a match.
