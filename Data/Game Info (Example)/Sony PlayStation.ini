Description=Tenrin O Genmu is one of the games based on the animé and manga series 3x3 Eyes. The animé and the game tell the story of Yakumo, a normal Japanese teenager who studies and works as a waiter, and Pai, a girl who belongs to the race of Sanjiyan, the immortal three-eyed people. After discovering the secret of eternal youth and immortality many hundred years ago, the Sanjiyan could not remain human, and became cruel demons who can possess people and turn them into Wu (Chinese for "nothing"), immortal, powerful, and obedient servants. Pai, who looks like a young girl, but is nevertheless three hundred years old, was terrified by what the Sanjiyan have become, and swore she will find a way to become human again. She meets Yakumo, whose late father was a scientist who helped Pai on her quest. Accidentally, Pai uses the powers of her third eye on Yakumo, and he becomes her Wu! Trying to regain their lost humanity, Yakumo and Pai are confronted by the evil Benares, the Wu of Sanjiyan ruler. In pursuit of Benares and his henchmen, Yakumo and Pai travel to India, to the Easter Island, and to many other countries. Will they be able to stop Benares and to become human again?<br><br>This is an adventure in Japanese fashion, which plays like an interactive animé. The 3 CDs on which the game comes are full of animé cut scenes, and the locations of the game are still shots in animé style. Unlike most Japanese adventures, the player interacts with the game world not by choosing commands from a menu, but by scrolling with a cursor on the screen. Once the cursor is placed on an object possible to interact with, it is highlighted with an additional command, such as "look", "talk", etc. There are no real puzzles in the game, but the cursor-based gameplay makes it a bit similar to Western point-and-click adventures.

Focused on a fictional North American league, with GHL (Gremlin Hockey League) club teams, the game enhances the graphics and gameplay of the previous version. While the game is unlicensed, all teams were inspired by their real NHL counterparts, from team logos to player names (using the classic trick of changing one letter from the name to other phonetically close). <br><br>Features include three speeds of play, a three-on-three arcade mode with smaller ring, network play and advanced body collision physics. Like NHL Championship (released around the same time), the game adds a coloured track to the puck named "GremTrax". Slower shots and passes are coloured green, and faster red (opposite to the blue/red combination used by Fox). Tactics were not forgotten, and the player is able to select the lines, select how and how fast teams build up the attack and are expected to shoot on goal and how to defend. If the player does not feel like controlling everything, tactical decisions can be left to the computer. It's also possible to trade players to balance or keep rosters up to date.

In both both (arcade modes and simulation), there is a speed button that makes players run at an extreme and somewhat unrealistic speed.

The usual game modes and options in the genre make a presence here, being possible to play cups, tournaments or leagues.<br><br>As with the previous game, the same fast-paced gameplay remains, while the regular mode isn't much different from the remaining sports game in the first years of the console, with the face buttons controlling the basic aspects of the game, such as passing, lobbing or kicking (or different kind of lunges on defence). However, the game gains a new dimension in the "arcade mode", where it's possible to bend the rules with infamous kicks to the head or unleash the trademark move of the series - the Predator Megakick, named after the then revolutionary boot models. However, doing those decrease the players' stamina meter, and after the bar is depleted, players not only no longer can make special moves, but also take longer to recover from a tackle, so longer games can be won (or lost) by the number of players that can't feel their legs no more.

Description=Two hundred years after the events of Alien 3, Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is cloned by military scientists interested in the Alien Queen she had become a host for. Like the "Company" from the earlier films, the military intends to use the Queen to breed a force of bio-weapons. But then something goes wrong; the Aliens they are studying manage to escape, and swarm throughout the science ship. It's up to four stranded heroes - Ripley, Call, DiStephano and Christie - to wipe out the Aliens, and return the ship safely to Earth.<br><br>Gameplay is standard FPS action, with limited ammo and plenty of hazards to detour around or find the switch to deactivate. The player switches between the four main characters at each level change, each with a slightly different set of abilities (Call has a motion tracker, Christie has his twin pistols from the film). Levels are based around keeping the Auriga running, and making their way through the ship to escape.<br><br>The game uses a true 3-D engine, allowing for ladders, rooms over rooms, and the ability to look up and down. Aliens also make use of the 3-D space, and can crawl along walls and ceilings, or leap out from the shadows to attack. Scripting is also heavily used, to set up cinematic moments (such as an Alien chasing a fleeing guard) throughout the levels.

Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.<br><br>Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).<br><br>Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. <br><br>Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark.

This character is then positioned with the digital pad facing the bowling lane and its pins. Pressing X starts the ball launch where the screen switches to a side view of the character holding the ball and three gauges appear: Two tricolored ones for speed and accuracy and a smaller green one for putting a spin on the ball. Initially, the player can fill the spin gauge by pressing both the digital pad and X. After some seconds, a fast meter starts to move on the other gauges. The objective is to press X when it reaches the yellow band on each gauge. If it misses this mark, the character fumbles and drops the ball.

Description=ANIMORPHS: Shattered Reality is a quasi-3D platformer based on the popular Scholastic book series.  A quick back story: Earth is being secretly conquered by an alien race known as the Yeerks, small slug like creatures that enter a hosts ear, latch onto their brain, and completely control them.  The only thing standing between the Yeerks and total domination is the Animorphs, a group of kids who have the power to morph into any animal form they can touch.  <br><br>In Shattered Reality, the leader of the Yeerk invasion, Visser 3, has a plan to finally take over the world.  Using a device called the Continuum Crystal, Visser 3 plans to manipulate the space-time continuum in such as to change reality, making his invasion force the rulers of Earth, with no more Animorphs to fight against him.  However, as he activates the continuum crystal, is misfires, shatters itself and the shards of the crystal become scattered.  The Animorphs must collect all the shards of the shattered crystal to prevent Visser 3 from achieving his evil designs.<br><br>You then control the various members of the Animorphs crew, leading them through several differently themed levels (forests, swamps, urban, factories, underwater, subway tunnels, spacecraft, etc.) to collect the pieces of the crystal.  Most of the gameplay is jumping around on platforms collecting coins, battling aliens (when you encounter an alien, you automatically morph from your human self into your battle morph, which is a unique animal for each character), defeating the occasional boss alien, and trying not to fall.  A few levels are more of a 3rd person race, rather than platform based, as you navigate a dolphin, dragonfly, bat, or hawk (one of the Animorphs in another one of their animal forms) down a dangerous path.  All the levels are quite linear in nature.  At the end of each level, you collect a piece of the crystal.  If for some reason you fail in your quest, you get to see a movie of what happens to Earth when the Yeerks finally take over.  If you succeed, you are rewarded with a nice winning video.

Description=Specter, a popular attraction at the amusement park, has been transformed from a mild-mannered monkey into a scheming simian through the powers of the intelligence boosting Peak Point Helmet. Now he and his monkey army have taken over the Professor's time machine in order to to travel back in time and replace human civilization with a simian society. There's just one catch: Spike was caught in the time machine as well, and has been pulled back into the past with them. With the help of the Professor's numerous gadgets Spike will travel through prehistoric lands and capture Specter's army to prevent his evil scheme.<br><br>Because of the game's requirement of a Dual Shock controller, all of Spike's items are controlled through the right stick. Examples include a stun stick that can be slashed in any direction or spun in a circle, an RC Car that can drive alongside Spike as he runs, and a helicopter blade that can be spun rapidly to lift Spike or slow his descent. The goal in every level is to capture enough of Specter's monkeys to diminish their effect on history. Each monkey has different stats and personalities. Some will barely pay attention to you and will prefer to goof off or sleep, while others will attack you with machine guns, rocket launchers, and UFOs. Weapons will only stun a monkey, and they must be captured using the Time Net.<br><br>Finding every monkey in a level will unlock a time attack mode for the level, and collecting Specter Coins hidden in levels will unlock bonus games like boxing and skiing that use the dual stick controls.

Description=In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved.<br><br>Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.<br><br>Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a "wire framed" virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.<br><br>Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.

Players can choose to play as either Baby Felix, Kitty, or Tattoo, plus four others can be unlocked by achieving set challenges in-game.  <br><br>It is a standard tennis game with an angled view so that the opponent's court is smaller than the opposing player's and as the character approaches the net, the camera view slightly follows it. There is a training mode and a progressive Championship mode.  On different court surfaces, the ball moves differently. There is a meter for the serve where hitting it at a different point will give it a spin. Two players can also go multiplayer head-to-head against each other.

You are a synthetic lifeform sentenced for an eternity for a crime you didn't commit and in order to earn your freedom, you must compete against other prisoners in competitions in 10 different incarceration facilities. To compete in these competitions however, you must undergo a procedure that removes your legs and replaces it with a rolling sphere. <br><br>There are seven different events to compete in which are Pursuit, Last Man Rolling, Race, King of the Hill, Run the Gauntlet, Tag, and Powerball that pit you not only against your fellow inmates and guards, but against the levels themselves. Run the gauntlet charges you with making it to a goal point within a time limit, all the while avoiding other warriors and obstacles such as flame throwers, spikes, and gun turrets. Pursuit is identical, but it adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.

Description=Ballerburg is a realtime strategy game of a different kind. The goal is to destroy the opponent's castle (or something else, as described in the mission briefing). But here ends the similarity to any other strategy game. To accomplish your mission, you have no armys to command - your only weapons are ballistic: cannons, catapults and the like. Add a bomber airship and some magic effects and you get a very strange mix :)<br><br>Everything takes place in a 3D environment. You can build your own castle and it's surroundings, like peasant huts, blacksmith and so on and place some weapons. These things cost gold, and you get gold by collecting taxes from the peasants. To destroy the opponent's castle, you use your guns, catapults... You aim and shoot with an easy interface - you cannot see where the shot will hit before it has hit, so you need to shoot more than once to target more precise. You can have multiple guns and switch between them to bombard your enemy with heavy stones, cannonballs etc. You can even upgrade these weapons to become even more deadly. Be aware that you cannot fire these weapons all the time - they need time to reload and every shot needs to be paid.<br><br>And what does your opponent do? Well, the same as you do - he shoots at your settlement, trying to cut you short of peasants so you cannot buy anything (you should try the same :) and then finish off your castle. To hinder him, you can "disturb" him by using wizards. They can send sandstorms, rain (making a bad sight for shooting) ... <br><br>What does the name "Ballerburg" mean? It's German and can be translated to "Blasting castle" - "Baller" means to shoot something with really heavy artillery (it's "every-day" german language) and "Burg" means castle.<br><br>The game supports multiplayer and hotseat mode up to 4 players at once.

However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.<br><br>Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must clear.

The 3D movement in Toshinden 2 has also been made notably slower to prevent the heavy abuse it could be used for in the original.<br><br>As a result, while the core game play is similar, this sequel is more tactical than the original game.

Now, his spirit is reincarnated in a young, rather short-tempered boy. Fillet, the princess of Allucaneet, summons the reluctant hero to the palace and gives him the powerful sword Fusion, which he needs to defeat the evil Thirstquencher Empire. It soon turns out that the Empire is after another legendary sword, Lumina, so Musashi's first task is to get it before the bad guys do!..<br><br>Brave Fencer Musashi is an action game with strong RPG elements. Controlling Musashi, the player explores the pre-rendered backgrounds from third person view (similarly to  Final Fantasy VII), visiting towns, talking to NPCs, etc. There is a day/night cycle in the game, which is manifested in the schedules of NPCs and/or monsters, as well as Musashi's fatigue level, which increases if he doesn't sleep enough. Musashi uses the two swords, Fusion and Lumina, to fight his enemies. The two swords have different properties: while Fusion behaves more or less like a traditional melee weapon, Lumina needs to be imbued with various elemental items in order to unleash powerful attacks.

Description=Brigandine is a war strategy simulation game set in a active world where all of your army units and your enemy units fight and grow continuously.<br><br>The story takes place on the continent of Forsena where a coup d' etat has taken place in the kingdom of Almekia. You have a choice of selecting one of five characters from surrounding kingdoms to conquer the kingdom of Almekia and return peace to Forsena once again. <br><br>Gameplay is very much like other tactical games in that you first select the kingdom to attack, attack that country, organize your troops and repeat that process until victory. The gameplay is reminiscent of Ogre Battle in that when you envade a country you then select the towns or bases in which to attack to conquer that country. Your units will upgrade with experience from fighters to knights and barbarians to berserkers. Summon monsters like dragons and hydras to fight on your side which will grow with experience also. <br><br>As with Final Fantasy Tactics, the Zodiac (a favourite of 90's Japanese RPG's) plays a role in determining every units effectiveness against another.  Elements (Fire, Nature, Water, Thunder) and Alignments (Neutral, Light, Dark) also figure into damage.<br><br>The progression of a battle involves sending three Rune Knights and their retinue of monsters to represent your side.  Each Knight has a number of "rune points" calculated off of level, class, and particular attributes.  Each monster requires a number of rune points to have in the party, ranging from a ghoul (15) to a Lucifer (125).  Regardless of rune power a Knight can only have 6 units in his retinue.<br><br>Each castle/fort/town produces a set number of 'Rune Energy', which is set against the 'upkeep' cost of all alive units.  In this way larger nations sustain more powerful fighters, smaller nations must sacrifice fighters who they can not upkeep, and saving up rune energy can allow a nation to quickly bolster forces after a defeat.<br><br>The majority of the game takes place in 2D sprites except for the battle scenes which take place in full 3D polygons.

These buildings are created by shooting colored blocks at the same colored blocks that are already laid out in the playfield. The player only has a limited number of shots before the blocks on the playfield gets pushed down off the playfield. If the structure gets fully pushed off the playfield, the game ends. <br><br>Battle mode has 2 players competing against each other to see who can build and destroy the most buildings and earn the most points for doing so. To destroy a building that has been made, the player has to shoot a block onto the corner of it. Also, each building destroyed is worth a certain number of coins. The player must have 100 coins to win the battle. Both Puzzle and Battle mode allow the player to angle the camera upwards and downwards when viewing the playing field. <br><br>Arcade mode lets the player select one of eight available characters and has them battle against another player or the computer. Players try to form and destroy buildings as fast as possible, with some of those destroyed building blocks ending up going over to the opponent's side of the playfield. The goal is to get the opponents blocks pushed off the playfield.<br><br>The arcade mode is the only mode that contains the coin-op conversion, while the other two modes are Playstation exclusives.

Description=The Bushido code of honor governs the actions of the Samurai and sets a code of ethics for use in fighting. Sometime in the 20th century, a group of Narukagami ninja, each proficient in a different style, find themselves in a battle to regain their honor in the fighting ring.<br><br>Bushido Blade is a unique fighting game, in that Square did away with health bars, special meters, and other traditional gimmicks and allowed for battles to be won with a single hit. This realism made the game a fan favorite among certain groups. <br><br>Players select from among six ninja, each of a different fighting style and attributes. Players also choose equipment from among eight weapons, including Japanese swords, European blades, naginata and a sledgehammer. <br><br>Battles take place in wide open areas in which combatants can run around as well as climb up and down. Some structures, like bamboo trees, can even be cut down. In the single player game, players can even run through the entire castle, picking a preferred fighting ground location. In addition to the single player story mode, there's a versus mode, a slash mode where you will be attacked by 100 generic ninja in one long corridor, a training, and a 'POV' mode, which allows players to play from first person, heightening the realism. The game's versus mode can also be played using two Playstations linked up.<br><br>Gameplay involves picking one of three stances, then attacking high, middle, or low. Directions while attacking change attacks, and attacks can be combo'd. Player damage is location based, with hits to arms often making them useless, hits to legs crippling, and hits to heads and clean across the torso being mortal. The use of stances and the easily achieved one hit kills make Bushido Blade one of the most deadly, and therefore realistic, weapon fighters around.

Description=Two samurai families who date back over eight hundred years have been feuding ever since the Gempei War, where the Kagami family sided with the Minamoto and ensured themselves a victory over their rivals, the Sue. Over the centuries since, the two families evolved into ninja clans, but their hatred of each other never faded. Now, in the 20th century, the Shainto, descendants of the Sue, are in a position to bring vengeance on the Narukagami. <br><br>Bushido Blade 2 takes place sometime after the events in the original game and is also a weapon fighting game without health bars, power displays, or over-the-top special maneuvers. The game features the Story Mode, Versus Mode and Slash mode present in the original game as well as a new tournament mode, where the two sides face each other with shinai and other bamboo weapons in a kendo like ring. Fighters have different styles (including some with two sword nito and iaijutsu styles) and there are many weapons to choose from (although the hammer has been replaced with the yari spear). The controls have changed somewhat, but stances are still in the game, as are one-hit kills if blows strike a sensitive part of the body.<br><br>Initially players can choose from six warriors, three from each clan. As progress is made in the story mode, supporting characters will be encountered. If beaten, those characters will become available for play in the game's other modes.

Description=Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).<br><br>At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.<br><br>Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

Description=CART World Series, endorsed by Championship Auto Racing Teams, is Sony's first attempt at the world of CART racing. With the official endorsing and license, the developers were able to include a lot of realistic elements from the racetrack into the game.<br><br>All of the top-rated CART drivers (circa 1996-1997) have been included and programmed to match their real-life abilities (based on a statistics standpoint). Al Unser Jr., Bobby Rahal, Gil de Ferran and many more are there to use or to race against. Each one has their own unique car, which can be tuned-up and modified any way you'd like<br><br>Modification comes in the way of tweaking a car's performance. If you know a lot about cars and how they handle, you can adjust their tires to fit the road (hard or soft) as well as modify their gear systems and aerodynamics. By moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings, you may be able to find a perfect combination for speed and performance. During races, a car's tire will wear down and it will eventually run out of fuel. Pit stops are necessary for a successful victory.<br><br>In addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included  each modeled after their real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience.<br><br>As far as gameplay goes, you've got the following options: Arcade, Simulation, Practice, Single Race, 10 Race Season. The season play is simply a series of races in which you must qualify and race for the cup and the arcade and simulation modes both keep track of individual racer statistics. If you're still getting used to an Analog Controller, you may want to make a few practice runs before starting a season.<br><br>Additionally, CART World Series supports two players via split-screen or a Link Cable.

Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, CastleVania has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into Castlevania to find some answers and perhaps destroy the castle once again.<br><br>Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Dracula X: Rondo of Blood. The game is set in a castle which you can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of "special moves" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.<br><br>The Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies. All other releases are based on the PlayStation version, and do not feature these changes.

Description=Championship Manager Quiz is the unexpected result of developer Sports Interactive looking to branch out from their successful football management series called, funnily enough, Championship Manager. <br><br>If you think a quiz game may not be the best use of their skills then think again. This isn't just a collection of thousands of football trivia questions with points scored for each correct answer - that would be too simple. The football fans at Sports Interactive have managed to create a quiz game that not only mixes football knowledge but also the rules and tactics involved in the sport too. <br><br>The quiz is played out like a real game of football. You see the pitch and two sets of teams and get to pick who you want to play as at the start. The idea is to pick your favourite team as the questions will really probe your love for the club. From the kick-off, you must pass the ball around the field by answering questions correctly. Below the shirt of each player are question categories. Pass the ball to that player and answer the question correctly to keep possession. Of course, answer a question incorrectly and the ball goes to the opposition. Get the ball to a striker, answer the question correctly and you've scored. Whoever gets the most questions correct is irrelevant; the game is decided on who scores the most goals. <br><br>There are over 11,000 questions so you shouldn't see many being repeated often - in comparison, last year's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? game only contained 1,000! The questions cover a broad range of football knowledge too, from domestic to international, third division to golden boot winners. There are five different modes of play, including penalty shoot out, pub quiz where more than two can play and keepy-uppy where you've got to answer correctly for as long as possible.

Description=Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.<br><br>The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.<br><br>Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. <br><br>Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.

Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. <br><br>The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.

Description=Constructor gives the player the chance to run a construction company  in a place where real estate is up for those who want to develop it first and where everything is allowed to get rid of the competition.<br><br>Starting in a single plot of land with the headquarters, a construction team (composed by a foreman and one to five workers) and a repairman,  the player must start by building a wood mill and provide housing to the bottom of the social ladder: slobs. From there, taking advantage of their fast reproduction rate, the player can train new workers, and as soon as three different wooden huts are available, the council will allow the construction of a cement yard, which in turn allow the construction of better buildings. However, slobs wouldn't appreciate living in such luxury, and so a gadget factory can be built so that computers are distributed to their houses, allowing for a new generation of better educated citizens. <br>While the workers pack a nasty punch when in a large group, violence should be left to the professionals. After building a Pizza Parlor, the player is allowed to use the services of gangsters. These are able to take on that pesky foreman or that building the Council asked to get rid off.<br><br>But there's more to the game than build from ghetto houses to luxury buildings, and as they say, all is fair in war, and construction IS war. The player can send his foremen to capture other teams' buildings, or do even worse: provide housing for the scum of society. From hippies to ghosts, these can do a number on the other teams' properties. Want to stress out a tenant? Send the thugs to do a wild party in their house. Need some cash or materials? Send the thief to relieve a team from them. All this while avoiding the others do the same on you by assigning police patrol to key areas. <br>As time passes, it pays out to build other, more friendly, buildings. A school allows everyone to breed more civilized members of the society, the hospital allows recovery of wounds much faster or the park, where everyone goes to relax a little, among others. Improving the rooms and giving them garden furniture is also a good way of keeping tenants happy, but jealously can grow among neighbors. Failing to comply to tenants requests and demands will quickly turn the Council against the player.<br><br>The player will have to balance the output of their tenants to achieve success: overdoing one of the elements will take a dent on the bank account (leading to bankruptcy), cut the arrival of new workers (putting a strain of existing teams), replacement for deceased tenants (leaving houses vacant that eventually decay into a flaming pile of rubble not before giant cockroaches settle in) or police and mob favors (to patrol areas against undesirables and gangster actions). <br><br>The difficulty level affect what maps can be selected, but also which  actions the undesirables can perform. To choose higher difficulty settings, more computer players (up to three) must be activated.

Negotiations yield no result and the only hope is lieutenant Jack Morton, part of the original escort, who manages to sneak back on the train. His job is to take back control of the armoured train, stop the terrorists from deploying a nuclear weapon and rescue the hostages.<br><br>The game is played as a third-person shooter, but also introduces stealth elements, puzzle-solving and driving sequences with the train. The different compartments of the train form the levels. Next to regular movement, Jack can dash and use a search function that allows him to peek around corners and into rooms. Morton is in touch with the headquarters and also collects information about the organization on his way. The game uses an intelligent targeting system where the cross-hair changes colour based on the viewing angle. Shooting from a difficult position will do little damage, while open shots have a larger chance of hitting enemies. While progressing, the storyline is explained further.

This kart racing game features a number of new characters that are to be introduced as members of the Moorhuhn-Family (known from the Moorhuhn shooters).<br><br>The game features comic-style 3D-graphics, 5 different drivers - each with its own driving style - and 3 different game modes. <br><br>The whole concept reminds one of the Mario Kart games. The player chooses a character, either Moorhuhn itself or Lesshuhn, Snowman or Pumpkinhead. The game's objective is to win the race, of course, but your opponent will try everything in their power to keep your chosen character from winning by sending you off the racetrack. To achieve this they resort to things like weights, water bombs, chewing gum, boards larded with nails or even rockets. But the player can also find these so called power-ups, small packages that can be found at random order on the racetrack. Unfortunately, you do not know what is in the packages until they are opened which adds a little surprise to the action.<br><br>The kart is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard, but one can also use a Windows compatible gamepad.<br><br>The XL version lacks the Duel mode and two courses.

Instead of simply flying and running around, the chickens feature a lot of animated motion sequences that make them seem almost alive. The surroundings are completely generated in 3D and feature a lot of crazy objects and scenes such as two hedgehogs playing cards (one is actually wearing dark sunglasses!). The chickens try to hide in every conceivable place on screen, be it an old oven or in an outdoor toilet. They hide in wheat fields and even dress up as a sunflower in order to escape the player's dreadful gun. All these features make it more difficult for the player to get all the chickens. The actual shooting controls remain the same as in previous Moorhuhn games: the player aims with the mouse, shoots by clicking the left mouse button and reloads by clicking the right mouse button.

Crazy Climber 2000 takes the game play of the original and gives it a sweeping graphical makeover. <br><br>The object is again to scale buildings while avoiding the falling objects thrown at you by its tenants, as well as windows that close on your fingers. The buildings themselves are laid out differently In the first stages, for example, the buildings start out as square skyscrapers. Later levels, however, require you to scale round ones. As well as this, new threats are introduced, such as:<br><br>1. Circling vultures that throw eggs at you.<br>Gorillas reaching out to grab you on both sides of the building.<br>Window cleaners that go from left to right, making you fall if you get in their way<br>Boulders thrown from elevators<br><br>CC2000 also allows you to move from one face of the building to another. Also included is the original game, in all its early 80s glory.

Description=Creatures: Raised in Space is essentially a Playstation port of the pet simulator game Creatures 3, with modified gameplay mechanics. As in the previous titles, the player controls a fairy named Scrubby, who acts through the cursor issuing orders to the Norns when used over interactive portions of the scenery. Like in other life simulation games with artificial intelligence, the creatures can't be commanded directly and must learn behavior patterns through repeated actions. The Norns can get sick or exhausted and eventually die, and one of the main tasks is to manage the colony to avoid their demise, ensuring that all its inhabitants are well-fed and healthy by eating fruits and consuming medicinal herbs. A series of meters at the bottom of the screen show the population status.<br><br>The game takes place in space, inside a giant station with a domed ceiling protecting a closed ecosystem. The main objective is to open all the rooms, by ordering a Norn to carry a key to unlock a door or passage. Deeper levels have aggressive enemies and poisonous plants that have to be avoided by the Norns. There are blue stars scattered throughout the scenery, and the creatures can be trained to fetch and store them inside a machine, generating a new key after twenty-five stars. Norns can breed and lay eggs, producing offspring that takes some minutes to reach maturity.

Piracy is at an all-time high, and the Galactic Police are unable to keep up. Enter the Crackers: bounty hunters who take jobs that perhaps the regular police cannot tackle, efficiently stopping evildoers...so long as the pay is good.

The player controls the Pink Dolphin team as they explore each area, defeating enemies and collecting useful items. Combat is real-time, but the player must switch into attack mode in order to attack enemies. This gives the player an aiming cursor, but reduces movement to only left and right strafing. To make up for reduced mobility the player can also block incoming attacks. Each stage culminates in a boss fight at the end, and between stages there are short dialogue scenes that drive the story, as well as an opportunity to buy and sell items.<br><br>The team has three combat members: Amelia, Pink Dolphin team leader, cute redhead, and a crack shot; Drann, a large dragon-man who served under Amelia's grandfather during the wars, and who carries a large automatic rifle; and Liza, a girl from the Fox planet who wields a sword and talks like a samurai. Each has their own weapons and abilities, and the player can freely switch between them at any time. Each character also has their own life and weapon energy meter, so the player must take care to keep all three in good condition. During missions, they will also receive communications from their support team.

Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You're up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don't). You'll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there's usually a bit of puzzle involved. It's often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that'll let you access another part or another level of the map. <br><br>Between missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too). The missions range from simple sabotage to rescue.

Description=The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.<br><br>D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.

Other than Beckham himself, no player is licensed (likeness is preserved, but names are replaced with phonetic equivalents, such as Owin or Zanetee), but the editor also allows the player to customize each player and team.<br>Game modes include friendly, club season, several international cups (including the defunct Home Championship), Classic Matches (some featuring the highlights of Beckham's career, others just classic matches), Beat Brazil, where the player starts with France, and tries to beat Brazil with a progressively weaker team, Survival, where the player face top international teams, with goals against carrying over, until the player loses a match, and Train With Beckham, a series of  drill minigames destined to teach the basics of the game and unlock secrets. <br><br>Gameplay is similar to previous titles developed by the company (most notably Microsoft Football 2000 and UEFA Striker), and not unlike Beckham, has its strong point during dead ball situations, where the player can choose either to use a set play to get the defense offguard, or take a direct shot or swerving pass using the traditional arrow indicator.<br>In terms of options, the game doesnt offer much to tweak, only bookings, offsides, injuries, match length and the decider (simple or golden goal overtime and penalty shootout)

Description=Demolition Racer is a racing game with a twist.  Rather than a game that just requires you to try and win the race, this game gives you points to destroy the other racers' cars.  The game has many styles of game play so you don't have to play the same style each game.<br><br>There are 5 game styles in the Single Race section of the game.  This section does not count towards unlocking cars or tracks.  It is for practice and just plain fun.  The main style is Demolition.<br><br>In Demolition, you race against other cars around the track and get points for hitting them, spinning them in circles and knocking them into the wall.  You also get a big bonus for landing on top of a car which will immediately destroy the car.  When you finish the race, your final position is<br>found by multiplying the points you got from hitting the other cars with the points that you got for the position you finished in.  So if you finish first, but never hit anyone, you won't win the race.<br><br>The next style is The Chase.  This style is your normal race game.  You can still take damage and so can the other cars, but you are only trying to win the race.  You don't get any points for hitting the other cars.<br><br>Chicken is another style.  It is the same as The Chase except that you drive in the opposite direction as everyone else.  This can slow you down when you run into the cars coming around from the other direction.<br><br>The next 2 game styles aren't done on race tracks.  They are done in an arena.  This is a circle area which may have hills in it where you just try to destroy cars.  The first of these is Last Man Standing.  In this style, you try to destroy every car without being destroyed yourself.  You can still win if you<br>aren't the last car by making a lot of points by hitting other cars.  The scoring is calculated the same as the Demolition style.<br><br>The final Single Race style is Suicide.  In this style, you try to destroy yourself before any others are destroyed.  You don't get any points for hitting other cars in this style.<br><br>Besides the Single Race, there is also League Racing.  In League racing, you are trying to beat a set of tracks.  There are 4 leagues on tracks and one league in the arena.  In order to beat a track (or arena), you must place in a certain position.  The first league starts out easy; you can finish in 5th place and still beat the track and go on to the next one.  However, as you go up in difficulty of leagues, you will eventually have to place 1st on every track in the league to beat it.  A league will usually have 5-10 tracks to beat.<br><br>After you beat a league, you will unlock cars, tracks and other leagues.  There are 11 tracks, 3 arenas and 8 cars that you can get.  The cars can be customized with colors and logos.  You can also have portraits of the racers on top of the cars.

The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost.

The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.<br><br>Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).<br><br>The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.

Description=Destructo 2 is a simple color-matching puzzle game similar to Mr. Driller, originally released as part of a budget series in Japan. The main objective is to guide a cartoon character moving through an ascending pile of multicolored tiles, pushing the available blocks to create clusters of the same color. Groups of four or more tiles of matching colors can be removed by punching one of the connected blocks, with the vacant space being occupied by the falling stacks on top. The descending tiles that end up rearranged in new color clusters are automatically eliminated and give combo points.<br><br>As the tiles accumulate on the screen, the water level at the bottom starts to proportionally rise, receding when enough blocks are destroyed. The health meter for the main character is displayed below the gamefield, decreasing when suffering injuries from bomb explosions or drowning. The character also dies after being crushed against the top by the blocks. Power-ups and other items can be found inside containers that randomly appear on the pile, that have to be broke open with three punches to reveal their contents. The blue items give bonus points, eliminate all the tiles of a particular color, lower the water level and help in other ways, while the red items do the opposite and have to be avoided.

Description=Long ago a secret war raged between Heaven and Hell, each using humanity as its pawns. While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping.<br><br>As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.<br><br>Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana.<br><br>Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of the quest.<br><br>Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation. Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.

Description=Three years ago a brilliant scientist disappeared while researching a new form of energy. The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk's good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.<br><br>Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find "plugs" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.

A military unit is sent to the past to save the survivors and retrieve the research data. But nearly all soldiers are massacred by dinosaurs. You take control of Regina and Dylan, who managed to escape this fate. Now you must find the survivors, retrieve the data, and get back to your own time. <br><br>Dino Crisis 2 is a third-person action-adventure game, where you control the characters Dylan and Regina (switching from one to another at various points in the storyline). You will collect items and use them to solve puzzles while fighting the hordes of dinosaurs that inhabit the island. Much like Alone in the Dark, the game uses 3d models for characters, enemies and items and static 2D backgrounds for their surroundings. <br><br>Initially, each character starts with a gun and a melee weapon, but more weapons, such as flamethrowers or rocket launchers, can be bought later in the game. The dinosaurs' attacks cause you to lose "vitality", which can be restored using healing items. Sometimes an attack will cause you to bleed and thus slowly lose health; specific health items stop the bleeding. <br><br>For each killed dinosaur you receive "Extinction Points". By killing a couple of dinos in quick succession, you activate a 'combo' and thus get more points. The points can be used in "Save Shops" throughout the game to buy weapons, ammo (and cartridge upgrades which allow you to store more ammo within the weapon), healing items and "tools" (such as armor, more powerful melee weapons, or "cards" which allow you to get bigger combos). You can also save the game at these points. <br><br>While wandering around the island, you'll find many documents and letters to read, including "Dino Files", which contain a flavor description of a dino species.

At the beginning of each fight you are given a total of 4 fighters (up to 6 later) from which you have to choose the 3 that you would like to participate in the battle that follows. Each fighter has 2 bars  a green and a yellow one. The green represents the life force and the yellow the power force which is depleted with every attack you do. At the bottom of the screen there is a blue bar and a red one that form a gauge called Power Balance. The reason for this gauge to be there is because your attacks dont affect the enemies life bar directly. By continuously attacking the enemy the bar that represents your power (blue bar) increases while that of the enemy (red bar) decreases. When the blue bar covers all the gauge a random attack sequence, from the current character youre controlling, is initiated and thats how you can actually injure your opponents. The same can happen to you though if the enemys red bar covers all the gauge.

Description=A number of games allow you to search the tombs of ancient Egypt, but few allow you to do so IN ancient Egypt. Taking place (appropriately enough) in 1156 B.C., you play Ramose, a young Egyptian man who hopes to prove himself a worthy investigator for the current rulers of Egypt. Your first assignment is not an easy one, as a Tomb of Sethi I, a pharaoh has been desecrated and looted and your own father has been accused of the crime. You have three days to prove his innocence and stay the sentence of execution.<br><br>Gameplay takes place in a first person mode similar to fans of this kind of adventure game. Unlike some games that give you a static, unmoving image to look at, Egypt 1156 B.C. allows you to look around at any location in a smooth turn (similar to QuickTime VR, but with better results). This gives you a 'you are there' feel that many other games lack. All graphics are 3-D rendered and occassionally actions will give you a third person cutscene as a reward. Communication is through a simple branch tree and both talking and puzzle solving involves the manipulation of objects, both in and out of your inventory. <br><br>In addition to being a mystery/adventure game, Egypt 1156 B.C. also comes with reference material about ancient Egypt, its people, and its culture. These are available whenever you discover something interesting in the middle of the game or can be accessed via the main menu.

Description=Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring is an arcade-style fighting game from the makers of the Final Fantasy series. In the port for the Playstation - Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie, Vincent, Zack, Red XIII & Sephiroth from FF7 join the many characters from the arcade game released in Japan. This is a free roaming beat-em-up that can only be likened to the more recent Power Stone on the Dreamcast.<br><br>Comprised of the main arcade mode, mini-game mode, and an all new RPG mode known as "Brand New Quest".<br><br> The mini-game mode contains four games:<br><br> - Battle Beach, a triathlon of button mashing.<br><br> - Battle Square, tackle-Othello on a disco floor<br><br> - Infinity Battle, an endurance test with unlimited lives.<br><br> - And a foot racing game using the fighting game controls.<br><br> The main game mode is an arcade-style fighting game.  Charismatic fighters from around the world compete in a tournament for a mysterious sword as the prize.  In addition to your archetypes of kick boxers, wrestlers, and mixed martial artists there are also animal type fighters, homing missiles, characters with swords, and many other attacks that shake things up.<br><br> The fighting system is based on attack height (much like Bushido Blade) - with the triangle, square, and x buttons corresponding to high, mid, and low attacks respectively.  There are also different buttons for low and high guard - both working against mid-level attacks but specific to high and low attacks.  The circle button is used for 'special' attacks, which drain the 'special' bar.  There is a button to jump, as well as a button that changes between 'locking' on the target to move or free running.<br><br> The standard balance in fighting games is speed vs. damage.  Whether it be ranged or melee attacks, the 'damage per second' should be the same - as every character has an equal health bar.  Ehrgeiz is a very balanced game, despite the complexity presented by how fundamentally different most characters are.<br><br> The vast differences between certain characters require the player to devise separate strategies for different opponents. The animal type opponents, for example, can only be hit with roughly half the attacks of the normal opponents - head kicks, many long range attacks, and most throws will hit empty air, especially since animal characters can 'duck' even lower to the ground. Fighting a gun wielding character will result in a battle where you must chase and pin down. Fighting Cloud or Sephiroth will require both constant pressure and vigilance against being thrown to ensure that they are not able to unsheathe their sword and finish the fight in a few blows. <br><br> The game features unlock-able costumes and characters, as well as 'ending videos'.<br><br> The "Brand New Quest" feature is a dungeon delver that uses the fighting game engine along with randomly generated dungeon layouts to create a 25 level dungeon with set bosses.  It borrows the magic and equipment system from the Final Fantasy games, you will collect materia and magic stones, as well as a full range of visibly different weapons and armour.  This game puts strong emphasis on food (like the early Ultima series).  Not only will you have to eat, but you will have to be conscious of what you are eating - your diet affects how your stats change at level up.  Eat meat for strength, minerals for dexterity, carbs for speed, lipids for defence, and vitamins for magical ability.  Standing still allows your depleting 'stomach' meter to fill your health.  If your hunger meter reaches 'zero', however, it will start draining your health.  <br><br> There are two playable characters, and the game can be played with both characters or with only one.

Description=In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.<br><br>On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.<br><br>The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.

Passing through the checkpoints throughout the track will replenish your time limit, but you have to be quick and careful not to crash into anything!<br><br>In the beginning, you start off with only two tracks, six vehicles, and the Practice and Championship modes. By successfully clearing the game modes in specific ways, you can unlock more tracks, vehicles and additional game modes. There's also a two player mode which can be accessed using the PlayStation Link Cable.

Description=Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it's not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing abilities. It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. <br>The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).<br><br>The main gameplay change was the addition of "First Touch" controls. By performing one of the "trick" moves before the player gets possession of the ball it's possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the "Off The Ball" controls (allows the control of players that aren't in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged.<br><br>Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums.<br><br>As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up around 11'000 real footballers.

The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".<br><br>But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...<br><br>The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.<br><br>The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous  Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.

Description=The seventh installment of the Final Fantasy series takes place in a post-modern, steampunk, sci-fi world where high technology reigns and where robots and bio-engineered mutants co-exist with humans and dragons.<br><br>The story focuses on Shinra Inc., an evil mega-corporation responsible for all the world's high technology. Shinra supports this technology with Mako Energy, Shinra's patented source of power. Unfortunately Mako is the lifeblood of the living planet and by using it up Shinra is slowly upsetting the balance of nature.<br><br>In comes AVALANCHE, a rebel group of disenfranchised citizens who have taken it upon themselves to oppose Shinra's ambitions. The main character is an ex-Shinra soldier named Cloud Strife, an angst ridden fella with a complex history that's explained as the game goes on. Cloud joins up with AVALANCHE as a mercenary for hire, and together they take on Shinra's maniacal executives and their army of shock-troops, robots, and mutants. However after a while it becomes apparent that there are other forces at work, and ultimately Cloud must not only fight against Shinra, but also stop a powerful man from his past from destroying the world.<br><br>Final Fantasy VII updates the Esper character growth system from Final Fantasy VI into the Materia system. Instead of magic spells, abilities, and bonus stats being saved to a single character, they are saved to the materia itself, allowing you to change a character's spells and abilities from the equipment menu at any time. Also updated from VI are character-specific abilities, now called Limit Breaks. By sustaining enough damage without dying a character will build up their Limit Gauge, which when filled can be expended to do a much more damaging attack than normal. More powerful Limit Breaks are unlocked as previous ones are used, and acquiring the most powerful Limit Break of each character will require completion of sub-quests. Final Fantasy VII also features plenty of mini-games and many ways to explore the game world, including the submarine first introduced in  Final Fantasy III.

Squall is not a particularly friendly guy and has troubles with his fellow students and teachers. On the eve of his graduation hostilities break out between the city-states of Galbadia and Dollet. As their final test, Squall and three other students are sent on a mission to assist in the fight against Galbadia.

It introduces many gameplay changes compared to the previous installments of the series. The player does not acquire money from random enemies, but instead receives paychecks over time based on the player character's SeeD rank. Party members can be customized by equipping them with magic spells, which can be "drawn" from enemies in battles. When used in combat, this spells act like expandable items; there are no MP (magic points) in the game. The trademark summoned monsters (called Guardian Forces in this game) play a very important role in the customization process. They can be "junctioned" to to the characters, acquire experience points of their own, learn and "teach" characters new abilities, and naturally also be summoned in battles.<br><br>As the  previous installment, Final Fantasy VIII features several mini-games, the most prominent of which is the card game Triple Triad. Cards can be won in matches or acquired through side quests or by transforming enemy monsters. Many characters in the game can be challenged to a game of Triple Triad, so it is always possible to take a break from saving the world to play cards with the locals.

You race in five distinct worlds: a group of linked islands (Archipelago), a droid factory (Droid Gardens), a desert wasteland (Terrian Dunes), an industrial area (Sky Port) and a wealthy city (Aerial City). While racing, the personal weapon is stored in the left weapon bay. Random weapons that can be picked up by all racers are stored on the right. There are both offensive and defensive specials, including missiles, rockets, cannons, turbo, shield and a worm hole that teleports your opponents. Upon completing a perfect lap, you receive a special weapon, such as the stasis beam (immobilization) or the time warp (slow opponents down).<br><br>Vehicles can be slowed down but not destroyed, so he who crosses the finish line first still takes it all.

The single player mode includes championships divided over three leagues with increasing difficulty. Each league contains five worlds, with a different theme, and each character has a homeworld. There are qualifier races, heats (one-on-one) and final races where the grid is based on the results of the previous races.

Description=Yokosuka, Japan, 2112 AD. The young student Kazuki Takemura works as a test pilot with Kirishima Industries, a production company of military battle wanzers (walking panzers), mechanized walking robots with movement similar to that of a human being. Kazuki has just finished testing the combat capabilities of the new Zeinslev prototype in the lab. Finishing his day's tasks he is asked by his best friend Ryogo to help with a company delivery to the Japanese Defense Force (JDF) military based. This simple choice determines where Kazuki is when strange things begin happening in Japan. A large explosion, a wanzer theft, his sister Alysia being hunted, rumors of a powerful weapon, and accusations of involvement by agents of both the OCU and the USN all make the situation more complicated. Kazuki is swept up in a plot of conflicting loyalties and attacked by various factions. He will need to recruit additional characters and wanzers in order to be victorious in battle and investigate leads to uncover what is going on.<br><br>Front Mission 3, like other games in the Front Mission Series is a turn-based strategy game featuring real-time environments, CG movies, mechanized robots and strategic battles. The game contains two independent storylines with different situations, environments and unique characters made up of different set of allies and enemies. The majority of the game takes place on the battlefield where Kazuki and his allies are controlled in an overhead view 3D environment. The game is tactical and nature, so the player chooses his unit and assigns where it will be moved and what action it will perfom. Typical actions include attacking with a shoulder weapon (missiles or gernades), attacking with a weapon held in the hand (ranged and melee), using items, guarding against future attack and simply ending the turn. As chaarcters fire weapons back and forth at each other, they will inflict damage to different parts of the wanzer. Areas that can be damaged and destroyed/disabled include arms, legs, and body. Complete damage to the body will 'destroy' the wanzer in battle, whereas disabling other parts will merely render it less effective. Each weapon has a damage type which includes (I) "Impact", (F) "Flame" and (P) "Piercing". In practice these types function as weapon "elements" which can be reduced with the proper armor coating, however it usually renders it vulnerable to another damage type. Typically Anti-I defense is very weak against Class-P attack and defending against that is weak from Class-F and defending against that is weak from Class-I. Each weapon carried by the wanzers is also classified as either Ranged, Melee, Shield or Missile . Each pilot can have a proficiency in these skills, making the usage of some weapons by them more effective than others. Pilots also learn special skills during battle, these are activated by experience points, and amount of weapon usage. Special abilities are very dependent on the types of actions being performed and items equipped, so for example the ability "Double Shot" requires a weapon equipped in each hand of the same weapon class.<br><br>Between combat missions, Kazuki is able to save his game as well as explore the "network". The network is a virtual internet, allowing connections to the (completely fictional) websites of organizations involved in the Front Mission 3 plot. While exploration on the network is not required, it's exploration will uncover clues to some of the game's backstory as well as open up the opportunity to develop email contacts, obtain additional funds and unlock new wanzer gear.<br><br>Between certain missions, Kazuki will enter a town. These are represented by a simple graphical menu of different locations. Areas that can be visited typically include Pubs, Wanzer Equipment Shops, Wanzer Parts Shops and specific locations. Wanzers are mix-and-matchable so that feet from one model can be attached to another and different weapons carried. Different wanzer parts each have unique values for HP, accuracy, movement and armor. However each part and weapon has a "weight" value, which is determined by each individual Wanzer model's engine (as well as additional parts). A wanzer is always unable to carry more than it's maximum weight. Towns are also where Kazuki will often meet new characters and have conversations to uncover the plot.

Unlike several horse racing games from this time, you get to control the horse on the track instead of just watching. Actually, you really control the jockey. The controls basically boil down to hitting the face buttons when you need to get the horse moving; similar to riding the horse in The Ocarina of Time, only without the turning. However, you can't drive the horse on for the entire race, or else it'll tire and you'll be left in the dust.<br><br>Once the race is over, you get your cash. Each place earns you a specific amount, which you can then use to improve your ranks of race horses. If you'd rather not spend more money, you can also breed them, creating a &quot;super racing horse&quot; from two exceptional racers. The horse isn't really super, but it will almost certainly have a prolific career.

After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.<br><br>In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.<br><br>In the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and "myst" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on "CASTLE", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the "ERRANTRY" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.<br><br>In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the "LONGINUS" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the "BEAST" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the "HOLY GRAIL" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.

Description=This pack contains both the arcade classics Gradius I and II, ported to Windows 95, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn.<br><br>Story: the Bacterians are attacking the planet Gradius, and in a state-of-the-art fighter ship you have to stop them. Both games have similar gameplay and graphics, with only different music and level layout setting them apart.<br><br>Each of these side-scrolling shooters has over a dozen levels each, all of which are completely unique. There are no enemy types that are re-used from level to level (except for the boss who is the same in every level). You can collect powerups that provide things like extra speed, laser shots, target-seeking missiles, shields, etc.<br><br>While there have been many small modernising touches made to the games, there is still no ability to save. Be prepared to set aside a considerable amount of time to finish in one go.

Description=Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.<br><br>The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.<br><br>The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.

Description=Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.<br><br>Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.<br><br>Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.<br><br>Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.<br><br>Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:<br><br>- A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.<br><br>- Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>- Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.

Description=In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.<br><br>The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the <br>big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.<br><br>Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.<br><br>The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.

Description=Gundam Battle Assault 2 is an one-on-one fighting game, based on the popular anime series "Mobile Suit Gundam" and its various offshoots. You can play as the titular Gundams (giant walking robots) from a wide variety of series. The game features standard fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks and a variety of combo moves that can be executed by each Gundam. Note that the Mobile Suits aren't as mobile as humans, and thus the fighters' movements are slower and their maneuverability is worse than in most fighting games. <br><br>The game has several playing modes, which must be unlocked by using different Mobile Suits on the various difficulty levels. The available modes are: street mode, story mode, versus (a single duel where you can choose your opponent), two time attack modes (where you must defeat either 8 regular enemies or 4 boss enemies as fast as possible) and survival (defeat as many enemies as possible; fight until you beat all of them, or until one of them beats you.)

Description=Gundam: the Battle Master is a Japanese fighting game involving robots who will try to attack and destroy each other. Before you start the game, you can choose from a various amount of robots, each being smaller or bigger, or having different attacks. As you progress the game, your opponents will get more difficult to beat. During a fight, your temperature bar will decrease when you manage not to get hit by your opponent.<br><br>All the robots will start with 4 levels of armor. As you attack your opponent with missiles and bazookas, his temperature bar will increase. You can aim your long range weapons by holding them to the direction you wish to shoot at.

Special moves requires energy from the energy cap, which is shown right below the temperature bar.<br><br>Your opponent will be beaten when he is overheated. When both robots are at the same level of armor, then the current temperature will decide the winner. You can block attacks in the air when you jump, but you cannot block when you are dashing.

There are also portals between some of the "spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.<br><br>Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.

Description=Masahiko Kutani and Himiko Himejima are two teenagers living in modern-day Japan. One day, Himiko discovers a strange amulet. An immense power is unleashed from it, engulfing Kutani and teleporting him into another world. The young man finds himself in the ancient kingdom of Yamatai, where Himiko's "alter ego" is a divine queen. The queen election is just being held in Yamatai; but the evil general of the Kune empire sends his forces to conquer Yamatai and disrupt the ritual. Kutani has no choice but to offer his services to the kingdom, hoping to find a way to return to our world...<br><br>Himiko-den is a strategy game with RPG elements. Kutani and other heroes are navigated on the "world map" in a linear fashion; selecting a location icon usually leads to a large-scale strategic battle between armies. The player has to position the troops and navigate them on the battle field.<br><br>Once a player-controlled and an enemy unit come into contact, a turn-based battle initiates. These battles are similar in style to those of "regular" RPGs, with small parties of characters exchanging attacks until one of them emerges victorious.<br><br>Cut-scenes advance the story between the battles; some of them are animated movies, while others are composed of still anime-style pictures. The battles are done in real-time 3D.

Description=A futuristic racing game with hover cars, in the same line as Wipeout, using a modified version of the Magic Carpet 2 engine.<br><br>Gameplay takes a straightforward approach, with the directional keys controlling the steering and throttle, and three keys to fire the minigun, missiles or charge the booster. While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel, armour and missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up powerups in the track or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float on the track they are still influenced by the ground material: they slow down on dirt and even more on water. <br>Each track has a number of shortcuts or alternate routes that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or close randomly.<br><br>Includes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with the 1.2 patch installed) such as single race mode (with option to change the number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race (beating the ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what matters is finish alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight players can compete in the same race by taking turns, with the computer taking control of the players' vehicles waiting for their turn. There are six hover cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to choose from, which change the colour of the vehicle: Mad Medicine (white), Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks (orange), DethFest (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).

Some are provided by taking out enemies, but power-ups, time bonuses, energy, armor and a handicap that turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected.<br><br>Five cars are available, with different statistics and built-in weapons. The initially weak weapon is soon replaced when you collect upgrade icons. To activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can also save your game. To add to the game's length, each of the twelve tracks, based on the settings "city", "mountain" or "space", has three variations: reverse, at night or the combination of the two. Other features include a small diagram showing approaching cars to time your mines, and pumping electronic tracks to match the game's pace.

Description=The Incredible Hulk is an isometric 3D action game.<br><br>The popular Marvel comic book hero The Hulk returns to the PC, Playstation and Saturn systems to battle tons of lowly enemies and the occasional monstrous super-villain. When the lawful Pantheon society of superheroes kidnaps the green giant, he joins forces with his abductors and smashes through 13+2 isometric 3D levels (in a look reminiscent of the Loaded series of games).<br><br>True to the comic books, the Hulk relies on no other weapons than his massive muscles to punch, kick and crush his enemies. When he has accumulated enough gamma energy, he may use powerful special moves like a Vortex Spin or the Floor Hammer. Rare bonus items also allow the Hulk to summon one of the four Pantheon team members Atalanta, Ulysses, Ajax and Hector to assist in the thick of battle. <br><br>Most levels include at least one arch-enemy, such as Piecemeal, Trauma & Lazarus or the U-Foes. Luckily, the Hulks regenerative powers allow him to regain health slowly. Little seems to be left of the Hulks legendary leaping capacity, however, so the green meat ball is forced to hop from platform to platform every now and then. <br><br>You can find more information on The Incredible Hulk comic books in the trivia and links sections.

Luckily, Jackie is a Kung Fu master and has no problem with punches and kicks. You can also perform signature Jackie Chan moves like running up walls, cartwheel kicks, and even drunken Kung Fu. All of the moves are authentic, thanks to the motion-capture sessions with Jackie Chan himself.<br><br>In addition to barehanded moves, any item that is not nailed down can be used as a weapon, just like a Jackie Chan movie.

Description=Jailbreaker is set in a grim totalitarian futuristic society, and stars a rather physically well-endowed red-headed female thief named Shlla (sic, according to the game's manual and cover art), who is sought by the authorities and is the only "dangerous criminal" who hasn't been caught yet. One night she attempts a robbery and fails; shortly thereafter, she is captured by the guards and put in prison. Once there, communication with inmates convinces her that something worse than just prison awaits them all... and she is the only one who can find a way to escape.<br><br>Jailbreaker is primarily an adventure game. The gameplay mostly consists of exploring the prison and its surroundings, picking up clues, talking to characters to gain information, etc. There are no real puzzles in the game; most of the time it is just necessary to initiate certain conversations to trigger events or pick up specific items for later usage. There are also some action-based segments in the game, including a few combat sequences, situations which require quick movement, and timed events.<br><br>The game is done in real-time 3D, and is played from first-person perspective; it is possible to rotate the camera up and down, as well as side-step.

Description=The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!<br><br>There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.<br><br>This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:<br>Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons<br>2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.<br>3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles<br>4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon<br>5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...<br>6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.<br>7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.<br>8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.<br>9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger<br>10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead<br>11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.<br>12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.<br>13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful<br>14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.<br>15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.<br>16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.

Description=J-League Prime Goal EX is one of the first football games in Sony's console, following previous appearances in the SNES, Prime Goal is a straightforward action game with simple arcade controls. While the Japanese version features all 14 JLeague teams and fully licensed players, the European version features the same number of  national teams with fictional players, all from Europe. Game modes include friendly match, league and cup knockout modes, as well as an all-star game where the player chooses his stars from the best in the selected zone.<br><br>Graphically, the game uses a polygonal playing field, while players are represented using sprites, and gameplay features a combination of the face buttons to perform actions (passing, lobbing, shooting, tackling and so on) with shoulder buttons to add swerve to the ball, change team tactics on the fly or pushing the camera backwards to find an open team mate.<br><br>While gameplay is fast and simple, it has three quirks: first, unlike most modern offerings, the AI does not set up the target players for passes and crosses, making the player control the target player as soon as the ball is released in order to place them in the best position to complete the play, and also unlike most other games, the players are able to run freely off-bounds, allowing the player to capture a free ball close to the touchlines without risking touching it for a throw-in. The final main gameplay feature can be seen when the ball carrier faces a defender, as the camera quickly changes to behind the forward, as he tries to trick the defender into going the wrong way as the defender tries to steal the ball  by predicting where will the forward move, with the winner of the challenge being able to run a few meters unopposed.

Powerups are hidden in the scenery as well: there are different ammunition types for the Lawgiver, including rapid fire and heat-seekers. Also available are medikits, extra lives and rockets which can clear the screen of enemies.<br><br>Not everything on the screen should be shot at, however: sometimes, innocent citizens will cross the scene.

The game shifts back and forth as the player must follow each of the protagonist's individual quests, which ultimately intertwine in a struggle between gods and humans.<br><br>One of the game's innovative concepts consists on keeping track of each of the party member's will towards the protagonists. The protagonists may be hated or liked, and trusted or mistrusted by each of the characters they constantly interact with. Such relations change based on choices the player performs, and based on his actions during battles (letting a character die, for instance, would make him trust the player less). The relationships between each character also have an influence on each one's growth, allowing different spells to be learnt, for instance.<br><br>Battles are by default carried automatically by the computer, and the player may only interfere by selecting a primary enemy target, commanding spell casting or changing between offensive and defensive behavior.

For instance the Skeleton can jump on the opponent and stab them in the neck repeatedly with its sword while the Minotaur gores them with its horns. It must be said that the attacks in the game generally fit their respective monster.<br><br>There are only two game modes available with the main one being the standard "Normal Mode" where one player goes up against the six other monsters and finally a mirror match.  A second player can join in at any point (in fact it's the only way a second player can play as there is no Vs mode). If one completes this mode they are presented with a breakdown of their performance in each fight, though no ending in the real sense, as the game has no story at tall to explain why these monsters are fighting each other.<br><br>The second game mode is an innovative mode the game calls "Auto Mode" and devotes most of its manual to. In this mode the player functions as a side line trainer to train and guide an AI controlled monster (selectable from one of the same seven as the Normal Mode) through several tournaments. This is done by pressing various buttons on the controller to tell your monster to try to perform certain offensive or defensive plays.<br><br>The monster you are training start's of with little more than the ability to throw a punch and is slow to respond to your prompts, but will gain additional attacks and respond quicker and more intelligently to your prompts the more it fights, until it ultimately gains the full range of attacks it would have in the Normal Mode.<br><br>However the full potential of this mode is undermined by the games lack of any save feature.

Description=The first sequel in the King of Fighters series picks up a year after the end of the first tournament. Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...<br><br>The King of Fighters '95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of The King of Fighters '95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the "team edit" concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the "team edit" feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.

Description="Violent fighting to come again!"<br><br>SNK's flagship series returns for another year. Many of the changes in this year's KOF release come in the form of improved graphics, sound effects, music and totally redone character sprites. The gameplay of the system has been altered with the addition of "Rush" multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear.<br><br>The King of Fighters '96 has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default "Team Fighting" mode or the traditional "Single Fighter" style of gameplay, plus the "Versus" and "Survival" gameplay modes.

Description=Another year, another KOF. Additions this year come in the form of slightly improved graphics and sounds, new moves and a new game mode. Gameplay is much more plot-driven, as you have middle-bosses that can change depending on what team you select. In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain "Edit Team" combinations are selected.<br><br>As of The King of Fighters '97, you can play in either the Extra or Advanced game modes. Extra Mode is the typical AOF/KOF scheme, in which your power gauge fills up as you defend yourself or charge yourself up. The new Advanced Mode, on the other hand, only allows you to charge your gauge as you perform special moves and attacks, similar to the Street Fighter series. Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll past and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent "Super Desperation Move" (or SDM) at any time provided the character has at least two full bars of charged energy stored. In contrast, SDMs can only be performed in Extra when a character has less than a quarter of their health left.<br><br>New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of "Blue" Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, The King of Fighters '97 sports 29 separate characters (without counting the six Orochi-related boss characters, which are all accessible via a secret code).

Most of the characters from the past four years return, thus providing the player with a very large roster containing 38 characters. Many of the characters have been altered in an attempt to make the game balanced regardless of the player's choice of fighter. Rugal Bernstein is provided as a non-secret character for the first time in KOF '98, and several regular characters have hidden "alternate" versions that may also be used in-game. <br><br>KOF '98 uses the same gameplay system present in The King of Fighters '97, so players may still choose between Extra and Advanced modes. In addition to the Survival battle mode and the ability to choose between Single Play or Team Play, versions of the game on console systems that use CDs to contain their media (PSX, Neo-Geo CD) also include an Art Gallery one may look at.

Description=Ten of Konami's classic arcade games, originally released from 1981-1985, make their their Playstation debut in this compilation:<br><br>Pooyan - As your fellow pigs lower and raise you in an elevator for the perfect shot, you must defend them against the wolves.  Shoot their balloons with arrows or make a bunch of them lose their grip by hitting them with meat.  Time too many shots poorly and the wolves will inch their way up the tree towards you and the other pigs.  The higher they get, the higher of an area you're restricted to for aiming.<br><br>Circus Charlie - Six games of timing, reflex and patience in one, each more difficult than the last.  Jump a lion through hoops and over flaming urns.  Hurdle over monkeys on a tight rope.  Bounce from trampoline to trampoline.  Roll and leap from ball to ball.  Avoid being knocked off your horse by jumping over or bouncing off of springboards.  And at the most challenging level, fly from trapeze to trapeze.<br><br>Shao-Lin's Road - Leap from level to level, kicking henchmen and their tougher bosses.  Collect powerups like the roatating energy ball and the spiked ball.<br><br>Roc 'N Rope - Cavemen and lizards impede your climb to reach the elusive Phoenix.  Your only tools are a rope and flashlight.  Throw your rope, climb up, and avoid your enemies or blind them with your flashlight.<br><br>Yie Ar Kung-Fu - One of the granddaddies of one-on-one fighters.  Start with the giant Buchu, working your way up through the ranks against armed opponents using only your punches and kicks.  Each angle combined with either punch or kick provides a different attack.<br><br>Scramble - Fly your rocket through enemy territory, avoiding enemy missiles or taking them down with your blasters or bombs.  If you run out of fuel, you're history, so remember to shoot the fuel tanks to refuel.<br><br>Road Fighter - A high-speed top-down racer.  Pass other racers to increase your score.  Crashing results in fuel penalties.  Run into the multi-colored fuel cars or run the risk of running out of gas.<br><br>Super Cobra - The speedy sequel to Scramble.  Pilot your helicopter through similar territory, once again taking out rockets and fuel tanks.  But now, you'll have to contend with turrets and other new enemies.<br><br>Gyruss - Wave-based shmup in which you move your ship around the screen in a 360 degree loop.  Avoid the swooping enemies and their shots.  Grabbing the double shot increases your chances of survival.<br><br>Time Pilot  Pilot your craft in every direction through borderless levels spread across time.  Biplanes, blimps, and more will try to take you out before you can eliminate them.  Catch parachuters for bonus points.<br><br>Each game, originally mated with a vertical monitor in the arcade, has been shrunk to fit the horizontal display common to most homes.  Accomodating for the smaller playfield size, scores, lives and power meters for most games have been moved to the previously empty space on the righthand side.<br><br>Added features include the following:<br><br>Saving - Retain all of your high scores.<br><br>Difficulty and Life Counts - Adjust them to your liking.<br><br>DualShock Compatibility - Use the analog stick and/or add vibration feedback to games.<br><br>Histories - Simple history pages featuring release dates, screenshots and trivia.<br><br>Pre-game Instructions and Tips - Don't know how to play?  As the game loads, you are presented with a simple instruction set, similar to what would have been on the original machine.  Hit left or right at that screen for more detailed gameplay tips.

Description=The year is 1898. A young gypsy woman named Koudelka, who possesses unique spiritual abilities, is off to Wales, to investigate the mystery of the Nameton monastery. This monastery was once a regular place of worship, but later was bought by a mysterious man whose death circumstances are yet unclear. Rumors say that supernatural powers have appeared in the monastery since then. But when she begins to explore the monastery, Koudelka discovers she was not the only one who was interested in its past... <br><br>Koudelka is a role-playing game with elements of survival horror. Players take the role of Koudelka as she explores the monastery: gathering clues and solving puzzles. Gameplay is similar to a survival horror adventure, however, the combat is strategic and turn-based. During battles, players can position and move the party members freely on the battle field. The amount of actions that can performed during a turn depends on the dexterity of the character. There are also various support and attack spells to cast. Koudelka features a refined weapon management, in which the damage that is inflicted with a particular kind of weapon (bare hands, guns, maces, etc.) increases the more that the weapon is used. Eventually weapons will break, but new ones can be found from defeated enemies. When one of the characters levels up, players can freely distribute experience points to increase and customize any of their statistics and parameters.

Description=1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...<br><br>Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.<br><br>The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.

If you are familiar with the combat system of Xenogears, it's more similar to this one, but more complicated. Your choices aren't just attack, defend or use special abilities: the attack option itself has many choices: high-attack, low-attack, kick etc., a bit like in Revenant. Apart from this system, the game is a typical Asian console 3D RPG with manga characters, map-exploring, etc.

Past and present are closely connected, the destinies of great heroes are linked together, and Alex has to save Luna and the world with the help of his faithful friends and his love.<br><br>The game plays like a traditional Japanese RPG: you have a party where each character belongs to a certain class and has his/her own special attacks. The enemies are not random, but visible on screen. The combat is turn-based and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the rest of the game. You can position and move your characters on the battlefield. <br><br>This remake brings a lot of changes to the original game. Large parts of the story were re-written, new scenes introduced, the gameplay system refined. The graphics were also re-made to high-resolution 2D. In addition, both Saturn and Playstation versions feature long and numerous animé-style full-motion cutscenes.

Description=Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who flies on a, well, magic carpet and casts spells. The game has 50 levels, called "worlds"; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to "restore the equilibrium" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level. <br><br>To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it "yours". To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect "your" mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the "castle" spell at it to make it bigger. <br><br>The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors. <br><br>There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though. <br><br>Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3 dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time.

When you get to the base, the welcome wagon is made up of zombies and an alien virus that will make you look back fondly on the days of the Black Plague. <br><br>You control a team of three: Kenzo, Karne and Matlock. They enter the base from different airlocks and try to discover what happened. The reason for the whole "Stay alone, stay alive" warning is that if your team members come together they end up forming into a disgusting mass of flesh -- picture the thing from Leviathan -- called a Trimorph. <br><br>As you proceed though the base you find clues as to what occurred. In addition, you run into Trimorphs, some of the non zombiefied former base crew, that are bent on your destruction.

While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns.

Description=In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.<br><br>Mega Man is a side-scrolling platformer. Mega Man has the ability to jump and fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create steps. <br><br>Travelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.

In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world.  As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself.  Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.<br><br>Other additions to the game include the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.

He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.<br><br>How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp; Hard Man.<br><br>Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find.

Description=Metal Gear Solid is a sequel to Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. After the tragic confrontation with Big Boss, the hero, special agent Solid Snake, decided to retire and has since then lived in a secluded region in Alaska. But the US government recruits him once again for a dangerous mission. The members of Foxhound, a renegade special forces unit, threaten to use a devastating nuclear weapon if the government doesn't hand them the mortal remains of Big Boss, their former commander. Foxhound is now led by a talented, ambitious young man with the codename Liquid Snake. Knowing that the visual resemblance between this new terrorist mastermind and himself can not be coincidental, Solid Snake agrees to infiltrate the new Foxhound base, to destroy the unknown nuclear weapon, and to find the truth about his own identity.<br><br>The gameplay in Metal Gear Solid follows the prototype established in the two classic Metal Gear games. Solid Snake has a limited arsenal of weapons and cannot allow himself to pave his way to the goal by killing all the enemies. He has to stay unnoticed, to hide, to crawl, to wait for the right moment, to sneak, and to use various gadgets that will prevent him from alerting the enemy. The game utilizes traditional top-down view, but the graphics in this installment are real-time 3D.

It can also launch beacon bombs which direct the Servbots following Tron to either attack or steal anything in the vicinity. Additional levels include a crate stacking puzzle minigame where Tron needs to steal selected crates of valuables in a limited number of moves, and a first person dungeon exploration section where Tron must depend on the Servbots alone to clear out traps and enemies.

Various activities increase your skills, and it's important to remember which girl will be impressed by a particular skill. In addition, you also have hit points and gain levels, just like in a traditional RPG. Sometimes you'll be attacked by the knights from Valpha or other enemies, which will result in battles. The outcome of such battles largely depends on your previous training.

Along the way are math formulas on the side of the road, followed closely by 3 crates on the road, each with a number. Striking the crate with the correct answer for the previous formula will allow passage, while the 2 wrong answers are steel crates that will end your vehicle. The same action is repeated in a later level involving a forklift.<br><br>Another type of level has the yellow candy jumping from number platform to number platform according to the math formulas that a disembodied female voice calls out.

Another key difference is in the overall presentation; Monster Seed's gameplay and interface are a lot more simple than most other breeding games.<br><br>Similar to mother games in the genre, there's a brief tutorial of sorts, and then you're off to gather your own creatures, earning better seeds and other breeding components as you go. Just be careful with your critters, because if they die in battle, they're gone for good. Granted you can always breed more, but it can certainly set you back if your creature hatches at level five, but you lost a level twelve.<br><br>Combat itself uses a somewhat typical turn-based system, with a grid used to determine character locations, spell ranges and so on. Much like a normal RPG, you get to take turns giving commands to your main character and your monsters. Different monsters are better suited for different roles, with some better off hanging out in the back, attacking from a distance and others in the front lines, absorbing the damage and dishing out the hurt.<br><br>Monster Seed isn't the most innovative RPG/breeding game out there, but it is a decent game that will help any fan of the genre pass the time.

And the world of the game "Moon" is still there... and before the boy realizes it, he is thrown right into that world, as the grand hero he was always playing! Only when he arrives to the first village, he realizes the real Moon is not quite the same as the one in the game. The sword the hero is carrying is too heavy, the people are suspicious, and he has to find a way to please them and to find friends... and maybe even to come home some day. Will he be able to do that?<br><br>"Moon: Remix RPG Adventure" is partly a parody on console-style RPGs, partly a "serious" game with a unique gameplay system. In the "Fake Moon", the hero finds himself in stereotypical RPG-like situations, and even graphically this world ironically imitates 8-bit RPGs with "super-deformed" characters. However, the "Real Moon" is another story. The hero must talk to characters and perform their quests. Completing the quests grant him the trust of the people and the so-called "love points". Once you have accumulated enough love points through various quests and sub-quests (which you can choose freely, in a non-linear fashion), you can proceed to the next stage of the game. There are no battles in "Moon" - all the monsters in the game are dead! Taking care of those monsters' souls can also give you love points. The world of Real Moon has a day/night cycle, and people follow their own schedules depending on the time of a day.

Description=Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.<br><br>A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.<br><br>Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.<br><br>Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.

Description=In a surprising twist of fate, Midway made a Mortal Kombat game that focuses on perhaps the series strongest point when compared to other fighting games: it's storyline. The game casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that ocurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.<br><br>In a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass's Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4's Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.<br><br>Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting enviroment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a &quot;use&quot; and &quot;turn around&quot; buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight rpg twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.<br><br>Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK's series 2D engines. New features include zooming, 3d lighting as well as 3d backgrounds and characters, etc.

Description=Mr. Driller G is a another entry in Namco's series of arcade puzzle games. As in the previous titles, the main objective is to control a miner character and dig through layers of multi-colored blocks to reach the deeper levels of a shaft and score points. As sections are removed, the whole structure becomes unstable and dangerous. When large pieces of the same color fall on top of each other, they automatically disappear. The miner can be squished by the crumbling stones, or suffocate by lack of oxygen. Air pills and power-ups are found scattered throughout the level, and must be collected to refill the supply, shown as a meter at the right side of the screen. Special brown blocks act as a barrier and have to be drilled several times to break, removing a portion of the remaining air after being destroyed.<br><br>The single player game has three modes. In mission mode, the objective is to reach a specific depth and make as many points as possible, with several levels available to play right from the beginning. In scenario mode, cutscenes play between a linear succession of levels, where each shaft has to be completed to move the plot forwards. In time attack mode, the air pills are replaced with clocks that add a few seconds to the time remaining to reach the bottom of the mine.<br><br>The normal arcade mode has multiplayer variations that can be played locally with two controllers, where the screen is split vertically in the middle showing two separate mine shafts for each player. In Driller Race, the objective is to reach the deep end of a randomly generated shaft as fast as possible, while in Driller Survival the players try to outlast each other in bottomless mines.<br><br>There is an option called Net Driller, that generates passwords to be used on the official site for competitions and global rankings.

Description=You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.<br><br>Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.<br><br>The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.<br><br>The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.

Description=N2O Nitrous Oxide's gameplay is in many ways similar to the arcade classic Tempest. The game involves flying a ship down a tunnel. You can move left and right along the tunnel's walls, and fire into the tunnel. You have a standard blaster, and can pick up a range of special weapons along the way. You also can pick up a 'smart bomb' type weapon, that launches a firewall down the tunnel.<br><br>Enemies are all based on real world insects, and range from flies, though to mosquitos, scorpions and spiders. Each tunnel introduces one new enemy. After each tunnel has been cleared you have to defeat a larger version of that tunnel's new enemy before you can leave.<br><br>Mushrooms can be collected off the tunnel walls. Once you have collected the required amount, you can enter a bonus level. These consist of open tunnels, containing two items: eggs, and spinning blades. The objective is to avoid the blades, and shoot as many eggs as you can. When you shoot an egg you get points, however the ship also speeds up making it harder to avoid the blades.<br><br>At the end of the game there is a final mutant boss insect to defeat.

Description=Namco Anthology 1 has four remakes of games previously released on the Genesis and Famicom/NES consoles, containing also the original versions and information about each title:<br><br>Tower of Babel is a platform puzzle game where the player controls Indiana Borgnine, an archaeologist that must escape the various rooms of the famous biblical structure while collecting some treasure. Each room is a separate puzzle, where the main objective is to pick up and stack L-shaped building blocks to construct stairs or bridges and reach the exit door. In later levels, the player must also avoid touching roaming enemies like flying bats, golems and the priest guards. When the explorer gets stuck or the level is made unsolvable by a series of wrong actions, the select button can be used to kill the main character and reset the room.<br><br>Star Luster is a basic space shooter, where the player must defend a number of stars from alien attacks with a fully-armed starfighter. The game is played from the point-of-view of the pilot, showing the ship's cockpit with a central radar marking all available destinations and surrounding enemies and bases within range. The player must warp constantly between conflict zones and bases to fight the invaders and resupply. The game ends when all the enemy ships are eliminated, or the player ship is destroyed in action.<br><br>Wrestleball, or Powerball as it was known and released in Western countries, is a futuristic sports game similar in tone to Speedball, Brutal Sports Football and other titles inspired by the 1975 movie Rollerball. Two teams, either controlled by humans or the CPU, compete against each other on a modified version of American football, where drop kicks and other violent tactics are not only allowed but encouraged to achieve victory.<br><br>Haou no Tairiku, released as San Goku Shi II: Haou no Tairiku for the Famicom in Japan, is a strategy game very similar to Romance of the Three Kingdoms and other entries in KOEI's line of historical titles. The player assumes the role of a Chinese feudal lord, assigning tasks for subjects and choosing strategies for development and military expansion. The game is unique in this collection, standing out for its much slower pace compared to the other, more arcade-like offerings, and a very text-heavy approach with loads of menus and spreadsheets to navigate through in order to accomplish all the goals and conquer the land.

Description=This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.<br><br>Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.<br><br>The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:<br><br>1. &quot;Hot Spots&quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.<br><br>Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &quot;on-fire,&quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.<br><br>&quot;Juice Mode&quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.<br><br>&quot;Tournament Mode&quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.

Late hits and pass interference are no problem, and you can even taunt and trash talk. To promote aggressiveness, opponents, when properly injured, can be out for an entire season.<br><br>The game modes includes exhibition matches, a regular season and play-offs. There are detailed statistics, and you can sign, release or even create new players to build your team.

Description=The millennium installment in the NHL series brought as usual updated rosters, featuring for the first time the Atlanta Thrashers,  plus enhanced graphics and sound.<br><br>The two main features of the game are the new Dynasty mode, allowing a player to lead a team to success for 10 straight seasons, while keeping an eye on the new talent on the yearly drafts and trading with other teams, and the face import feature, which gives the chance to assign each custom player their own face based on a photo. To do so, a photo must be placed in a folder, imported and then hotspots (head shape, eyes, nose and mouth) must be set, to define how the texture will be mapped into the face model. <br><br>Gameplay became a lot faster and tougher, and two new moves were included: "Big Hit", to flatten the oppositions' golden boy, and "Special Movement", to go around those tough defenders with ease.  Other new features include individual player and goalie boost (to give an handicap for a team), jersey selection, including classic throwback jerseys.<br><br>One of the most important changes done to the game was how the game timer worked: before, the period length on the clock matched the time set by the player, but starting with NHL 2000, every period has 20 minutes which are compressed into the time set by the player. This makes penalties a lot shorter (a minor elapses in just 30 seconds in a five minute period setting) thus reducing the powerplay percentage, which experienced players could keep in the high 90's in previous games, but also fixes the handicap of goaltenders in played games (a goaltender that suffered a single goal would have his GAA a lot higher than a goalie that suffered more goals in a simulated game).<br><br>The rest of the game remains as usual: 28 teams can play in a season (with the ability to choose between a short, medium or long season length), setting the then new NHL overtime loss point, playoffs (with best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches), international tournament and shootout. The beginner mode continues to be featured, and allowing players to feel the ice for the first time without having to deal with complicated controls, penalties or tough opponents. <br><br>Bill Clement replaced Daryl "Razor" Reaugh in colour commentary, and Jim Hughson remains in play by play. Alternative rock band Garbage provided the lead track (Push it!, from their Version 2.0 album).

Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.<br><br>Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.<br><br>As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a "Brett Hull". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.<br><br>The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.<br><br>Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.

Like in Mars Matrix, destroyed enemies release pickups, but rather than powering up your weapons they now affect your score multiplier. The multiplier is always slowly counting back to zero, but picking up the Score Items released by enemies will increase it. If a Score Item falls out the bottom of the screen, the multiplier is reduced, and can in fact go into negative, at which point the player will actually lose points for destroying enemies. The score can even go negative, and this is actually a viable method of play as the game will also track the lowest scores in addition to the highest ones.<br><br>You have a standard shot (upgradable through pickups), bombs (which can also be picked up), and an attack called the "hagu launcher" which makes your ship crash into enemy ships to destroy them, and must be recharged after use. The game has six stages, and includes the original arcade mode as well as a score attack mode.

The food factories have found a new type of meat - delicious to all the inhabitants, and no-one knows the recipe. Following his stomach, Abe eavesdrops on the corporate leaders' conversation, and makes the most frightening and disgusting discovery: his own race is that secret delicious food. <br><br>Alas, Abe is discovered, and the guards are marching towards him. He must escape, but he can't leave his friends to mercy of those eaters. He must rescue as many as he can, and tell the world the truth that lies beyond.<br><br>Essentially Abe's Oddysee is a platform game, though with a darker atmosphere than most titles in the genre. The game has several unique gameplay features. Abe is almost completely helpless, cannot wield weapons, and can be easily killed by his brutal enemies. That's why most of the game involves moving with careful timing, sneaking, and outsmarting your foes, even though there are also many parts where Abe runs and jumps, as in most platformers. Abe's only power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while, and also to open "bird portals". Opening those portals is the final action needed to bring a fellow Mudokon to safety. Before that, Abe needs to locate his enslaved friends and lead them out of the hostile environment by using what the game calls "Gamespeak". Gamespeak is a way of verbal communication through simple one-button commands, which are assigned to various expressions, such as "Hello", "Follow me", "Wait here", etc.<br><br>The game has pre-rendered background graphics, and uses pre-rendered CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.

On the eve of AlphaCore's complete assimilation of all technology, humanity becomes aware of it, and rather than bow down to it as king, as it expected, they attempt to purge it from the network. In response AlphaCore defends itself, locking all of humanity out of their technology and assuming total control of their weapons. Not long after this AlphaCore learns of a desperate plot: to build a time machine and travel back in time to remove AlphaCore's influence from humanity. AlphaCore steals this technology and hatches its own plan: traveling back in time to 1945 and inserting itself into the first computer ever built, ensuring that humanity would forever be subtle pawns in its machinations. It now falls upon the shoulders of Lester J. Henning, pilot of the experimental robot weapon Omega Boost, to travel back in time, stop AlphaCore's plan, and restore free choice to humanity.<br><br>The Omega Boost flies through levels on a predetermined path, although it can brake and boost in a direction to avoid hazards. The Omega Boost can fire a Vulcan rifle at enemies without targeting, or can lock on to and attack many targets at once with a homing laser.

But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!<br><br>PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.<br><br>Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!<br><br>The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.

Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.<br><br>There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.<br><br>The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.

Description=In Eternal Punishment, you play the role of Maya Amano, a young journalist who lives and works in a modern-day Japanese city called Sumaru. A series of mysterious murders have been troubling the city lately. Maya has to make a report and goes to a high school where the murders have taken place, together with a fortune-teller Ulala and a detective Katsuya. When they arrive at the school, they find the principal murdered. A man appears - a man with a bag on his head, who calls himself "The Joker". He says Maya and her friends will never defeat him unless they call upon their Personae - their other selves who can appear as mythical figures and help them in battles. The investigation continues, but now the young people have to face real demons... and perhaps the demons that live within their own hearts?<br><br>Eternal Punishment belongs to the Megami Tensei (Megaten) universe, and like in all Megaten games, it allows you to communicate with the random enemies. You can choose a party member to talk to the demons you encounter, flatter them, threaten them, make them give you Tarot cards that will allow you to summon more powerful Personae, or make contract with them in order to get information or rare items. You can also spread rumors around the city and see how they influence its life.<br><br>This is a direct sequel to the game  Persona 2: Innocent Sin.

Description=PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).<br><br>The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.<br><br>Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.

Phix must travel to five realms in order to bring the stone to its original place and return peace.<br><br>Phix: The Adventure is a 3D platform with a magnetic element similar to the earlier Super Magnetic Neo. The main character attracts or repels objects and enemies by switching polarity (between north and south with the ? button). Touching the enemy decreases the number of hearts at the left bottom of the screen. Falling on pits or water kills Phix instantaneously. The ? button shoots magnetic particles (enemies can be killed by particles of opposite polarity: north enemies are affected by south particles, and vice-versa). Pressing and holding the ¦ activates a neutral field that lasts some seconds and shields Phix from the magnetic activity around him. The X button makes the character jump. To reach higher places, Phix first must connect to magnetic spots on the ground by selecting the opposite polarity and then switch to the same polarity. Activating the neutral field at this exact moment makes him jump even higher.<br><br>The game has five worlds, each with three regular levels and a boss stage. It starts with two lives and a timer for each level (the character dies when it runs out), and allows progress to be saved to the memory card.

You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.<br><br>Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.<br><br>The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button).

Now, a long time after these events, the gems came into the possession of twelve mysterious characters. Each one of them tries to get a hold of the remaining jewels to fulfill their dreams - some of them seek peace while others want to satisfy their hunger for power.<br><br>Puchi Carat takes its inspiration from the video game classic Breakout. The player has to clear rows of gems with a ball launched from a cursor that can only move horizontally on the bottom of the screen. In regular intervals, the stones will move one row towards the bottom. Once they reach a line just above the cursor, the game is over. New rows of jewels also appear if the player is unable to catch the ball and it bounces off the floor on the very bottom of the screen.<br><br>The single player mode has four different variations. In trial mode, the player has to destroy a certain amount of rows to advance to the next level. Story mode pits the player against the computer in a split screen fashion. It is possible to send rows of stones to the other player in three different modes, depending on the attack pattern the player selected. The third mode is time attack: here the player competes for the fastest time destroying 50 rows of gems. The final mode is called rapid mode where the player competes for the highest number of rows they destroyed.<br><br>It is also possible to play against a human opponent. In this mode, difficulty and handicaps can be selected by the players. The player who wins the most rounds is the winner of the multiplayer match.

Description=Puma Street Soccer is a 4-on-4 football game, based on Puma's own version of indoor football. The field is small, surrounded by a hip-height   board players can use to bounce the ball. The rules are simple: the game starts like in basketball, with the ball being dropped between the two forwards in midfield. The rest of the game is very freeform, with fouls being awarded for awkward challenges (Penalties are given if the attacking player is on the break) and throw-ins (scored with the feet) if the ball goes above the boards. The player can select the tactics - from the three field players (the goalkeeper can't leave the goal area), it's possible to pay more offensively (with 2 in front and 1 in the back) or defensively (2 in back and 1 in front). While the real tournament was traditionally played on public parks and car lots, the game version includes these and more exotic settings, such as an airport, a ships' deck or in the middle of a city crossroad. The grand finals are always played inside an indoor arena.<br><br>After a team manages a number of shots, they are entitled to three "supershots", which are much more powerful and swerve a lot more than regular shots. The three shots, if well used, can turn a game upside down in a matter of seconds or mean the team will have to do a lot to make up for them if spoiled. While building up the Supershot gauge, the player has to rely on well placed shots, header, volleys, bicycle kicks or moving the ball in attack very quickly to score. <br><br>By winning competitions, players can unlock Puma-sponsored stars, such as JJ Okocha, Lothar Matthaus, Angelo Peruzzi or Gianluca Pagliuca and compete with them in their national teams.

Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)<br><br>The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game.

Description=QIX Neo is a remake of Volfied, Taito's arcade game from 1989. The graphics and sounds were upgraded, but the basic gameplay remains the same, with the player controlling a tiny ship moving over a green contour line. The thin line is drawn over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field, thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always following the movements of the cursor. The ship has a force-field shield around it, and only becomes vulnerable when drawing new lines.<br><br>The player has to quickly close the sections, timing it correctly to avoid collision with any of the foes or their projectiles. The enemies can be eliminated by connecting a section where they are standing, or by using one of the power-ups. The power-ups are stored inside boxes, that in some levels keep appearing and disappearing, and can be collected by removing a section with one of them inside. Most of the powers are temporary, giving lasers to destroy the smaller aliens, freezing the enemies for a few seconds, increasing the speed of the ship and helping in other ways. Each level is finished after removing at least 70% of the field, or if the large boss monster that shoots at random intervals is killed in some way. A port of the original game is also included, using the old assets but with a horizontal orientation.

Description=Developed exclusively for the Sony Playstation, this fourth title in the Ridge Racer series features new visuals, powered by goraud-shaded polygons, giving each car and track a more refined appearance, while keeping the same arcade gameplay popularized by the first game of the series.<br><br>While it includes the usual time attack and a new split-screen versus mode, the focus of the game is the Real Racing Roots '99, Ridge City's three heat, seven race championship, with the grand finale in a speedway during New Year's Eve.<br><br>The player starts by choosing one of the four teams available (from easiest to harder): Micro Mouse Mappy, directed by the lovely Sophie Chevalier who hopes to win the first title in many years for the French team to honour her ill grandfather, Pac Racing Team, a recently created Japanese team directed by Shinji Yazaki who expects to create an immediate splash in the Ridge City racing scene, from Italy the RRR champions Racing Team Solvalou, with the demanding Enki Gilbert at the helm, and the American team Dig Racing Team, who has fallen into financial difficulties, with team director Robert Chrisman struggling to provide the driver with a car capable of out-handling opponents.<br><br>After picking a team, the player can choose one of the four car makers available: Lizard and Assoluto keep the old RR tradition of cars drifting wildly on corners, but Age Solo and Terrazi offer a new experience with their "Grip" cars that require more breaking and careful trajectories, but are easier to control during turns.<br><br>The player earns (and so, unlocks for free play) cars by completing races; however, final placement defines how good the car will be. By scraping through the first two heats (the Final GP accepts nothing but a victory), sponsors will be unwilling to invest in the team and instead of a new car, the mechanics will only upgrade the current vehicle. But winning all races allows the driver to reach the Shooting Hoops speedway with the fastest car. By combining all qualifying placements, 320 cars are waiting to be unlocked.<br><br>R4 Ridge Racer Type 4 also includes an extra disk, featuring the original Ridge Racer in higher resolution. For a time, the game was also sold as a bundle along Namco's innovative Jogcon controller.

Raiden consists of eight vertical scrolling missions where the player maneuvers the Raiden craft dodging and destroying enemy robots, buildings, ground targets, and air craft.<br><br>Raiden II picks up three years after the player has destroyed the first invasion of aliens.  They are back, after raising another army!  Raiden II is more of the same, a vertical scrolling shoot'em up.  It has additional weapons, new enemies and terrains.<br><br>The game can be played alone against the computer hordes or another player can join along to fight simultaneously.  There are several types of "weapons" and "power-ups" the player can acquire by destroying enemies that make their Raiden ships more powerful and destructive.  One of the most unique and recognizable weapons from "Raiden" are the thermonuclear bombs.  They are perfect for destroying almost everything on the screen and softening up tough end-of-level bosses.<br><br>Other options abound in this arcade conversion including difficulty settings, credit limits, remixed music, on screen text positioning and the ability to save your high scores with a memory card.

Description=A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game.  One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.  <br><br>Any of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.  <br><br>One trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.

Description=The sequel to the chaotic off-road rally racing game, Rally Cross.  The lead programmer, Mark Lyons, and the lead artist, Scott Atkins, from Rally Cross had left Sony and formed a new company, Idol Minds.  Rally Cross 2 was one of the first two games developed by Idol Minds. It was an attempt to build on the original, while creating a game with a simpler learning curve.  <br><br>Rally Cross 2 retains the rough terrain of the original, with even more jumps and crashes.  Multi-tap and 4 player split screen were not included in the sequel, but 2 player split screen remained.   The ability to control attributes such as suspension, tires, and steering was added, as well as the ability to paint your car with a primary and detail color that can be picked from a large palette.<br><br>Once again the courses can be raised forwards or backwards, and in suicide mode(cars racing in opposite directions at the same time).  The multi-race, season mode, still exists.  One of the biggest additions is the track editor.  There are a dozen or so different pieces that can be rotated and dropped into a 2D grid to create completely new tracks.  <br><br>The cars are still flipped upright with the shoulder buttons, but it now requires only a single button press instead of the multiple rocking motions in the original.  Handling has changed significantly since cars tend to fishtail around the corners instead of flip, but high speed crashes will still result in an upside down car.

Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously.<br><br>The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon" flavor.  Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them.  Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage.

Description=Your Dad just got you an RC Helicopter. Play with it, or take it outside to complete various missions for friends and family. The missions range from cutting the grass in your backyard, to filming ghosts. With each mission, you earn points to upgrade your helicopter, (or even get new helicopters) and unlock more missions. Just be careful; your helicopter is somewhat fragile, and has a limited battery life.<br><br>RC Helicopter is a flight simulator of radio-controlled toy helicopters originally released as part of the Simple 1500 budget line in Japan. The helicopter is maneuvered with the analog sticks of the DualShock controller. The left stick controls the movement while the right stick makes the aircraft go up and down. A battery meter and a hit counter at the top right corner show the remaining energy left and the number of bumps that the helicopter can sustain. When the battery is drained or the machine received too many hits, the game is over and the mission has to be restarted.<br><br>The main objective is to complete all the missions available from the city map screen. At the beginning of each one, a character asks the player to perform a specific task with the helicopter. In some cases, the toy is equipped with special tools to complete the mission, like a squirt gun and a claw that can be activated by pressing the R1 shoulder button. In the first missions, the aircraft has to be used to transport soda cans to a garbage pail, cut grass with its blades, splash birds with the water gun, blow baseballs from a roof, recover document folders from train tracks and other challenges.<br><br>After completing a mission the characters give money as a reward, that can used to repair any damage to the helicopter and recharge its batteries. The mission money can also be spent on items from the RC shop. The player can purchase new helicopter models and upgrades, like a more resilient body for the machine, and more durable batteries.

Claire Redfield, the younger sister of Chris, and Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of the job, arrive in the sleepy midwestern town of Raccoon City only to find the city in flaming ruins due to the inhabitants having been transformed into mindless flesh-eating freaks. Although Claire and Leon team up, they are soon separated from each other and trapped inside the city by an accidental car crash. Barricading themselves within the Raccoon City police station, each character must find a way to escape from the nightmare while solving the mystery of what happened to Raccoon City. Each character will gain the periodic assistance of a fellow survivor... Leon will team up with a mysterious but well armed woman calling herself Ada Wong, while Claire will find herself charged with protecting a little girl named Sherry Birkin. <br><br>Besides the zombie population (which is much more diverse than the original, including teen girl zombies, maniac cop zombies, and even melting naked zombies), Claire and Leon will also have to deal with a variety of freakish mutants including giant poisonous spiders, walking venus-fly-traps, and speedy wall-crawling Lickers. They will also be pursued by not one but two seemingly unstoppable foes: a horrific and constantly evolving man-monster known as the "G-Type", and a taciturn but inhumanly powerful Umbrella agent who is nonetheless saddled with the rather quaint name of Mr. X .<br><br>Like the previous game in the series, Resident Evil 2 is a 3D action-adventure using three-dimensional polygon characters over two-dimensional pre-rendered backgrounds, with the action viewed through a variety of cinematic fixed camera angles in each room. Just like the original Resident Evil, players can choose to play as one of two possible characters. Each character goes through the same initial scenario, but with differences in the type of weaponry they find and the people they meet along the way. Unlike the original Resident Evil, beating the game for the first time unlocks a second scenario to be played with the character you didn't choose, with all new locations, maps, enemies, and a longer more climactic ending. Your actions in the first scenario can also affect the outcome of certain events in the second scenario. Additionally ammo and healing items are more plentiful than in the original game, although you still aren't given enough bullets to kill every enemy you meet.

The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill "master of unlocking" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you'll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.<br><br>A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know and... well, know from Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapons. <br><br>Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased, making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse.<br><br>The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.<br><br>The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.

The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. <br><br>There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. <br><br>In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.

Description=In this game, you control Cornet, a young orphaned girl who can animate lifeless puppets playing on her trumpet. One day, Cornet meets prince Ferdinand and falls in love with him. She joins a contest, the winner of which will have the privilege to marry the prince. But in the middle of the contest, an evil sorceress bursts in and kidnaps the prince. Now Cornet and her friends must defeat the sorceress and rescue the prince.<br><br>The game is in a certain way a parody on typical "save-the-princess" RPG stories, because here you are almost a princess yourself, and it is the prince who requires saving. Instead of FMVs the game uses musical performances to advance the story of the game, which makes it a kind of "game-musical". The battles are turn-based and remind those of strategy RPGs: you move around the battle field, and your attack should be in a proper range to hit the enemy.

Until one day, he met something and someone who he couldn't beat. A group of ninja assassins, the Jackal Organization, were harassing the town and Johnny brave as he was, got shot down. Johnny though, he didn't die... he refused to die... and sought the help of his father's friend Suzuki, who was a master of the legendary Zipang arts...<br><br>Johnny went away then... to learn the skills that would help him win and train hard to beat his opponents. It was long. It was hard... but Johnny's back now to save the town and defeat the ninja clan... no wait, he's Johnny No More... now he calls himself Zan... The Super-Ultra-Sexy-Hero Zan!<br><br>Rising Zan is a 3rd person action game with plenty of oddball humor and interesting situations. Zan, the main character wields the weapons of both of his trades... the Sword of a Samurai master, and the six-shooter pistol of an American cowboy. He'll need a variety of techniques to defeat the Jackal Clan and avenge his own lost battle. Zan proceeds through enemies and challenges in each level to eventually reach the boss who he then battles in some form of specialized combat or pattern. Once the boss is defeated, Zan gets the chance to unleash as much punishment on his foe in 30 seconds as he can; higher damage values will change the finishing move he uses to slay his foe.

Description=This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. <br><br>There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.<br><br>There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.<br><br>If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.<br><br>The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.

Description=Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.<br><br>Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of "boss" robot is put in your way. These "bosses" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!<br><br>The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.

The player can use 146 different parts and 72 colours to create a robot of his own taste. The different body parts that can be customized are head, body, arms and legs. Each body part has its own attack and durability ratings that determines how the robot will fare in combat. <br><br>The battles takes place in the Coliseum. The Coliseum consists of a number of rooms each hosting an enemy robot that the player has to defeat to unlock more rooms. Defeating an enemy can also grant the player new body parts as well as experience and skill points. The player can move around his robot from a third person perspective and launch different attacks such as jabs, straight, hook and upper attacks. With good timing it's also possible to link attacks together. A special attack can be executed when the SP gauge is full. There's also a guard impact command which allows the player to repel the enemy attack. The player has a booster which allows the robot to fly as long as the boost gauge lasts. A battle ends when one of the combatants has his energy reduced to zero.

Description=Romance of the Three Kingdoms V is the fifth game in the popular turn-based strategy game series, based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "San Guo" ("Three Kingdoms"). The novel, written by Luo Guanzhong, is perhaps the most popular classic book in China and all countries influenced by the Chinese culture (such as Japan). Its events occur in the third century AD, during the Later Han Dynasty. Several army leaders (the most important ones being Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Sun Jian) are trying to unite China under their rule, and each one strives to defeat his opponents.<br><br>Romance of the Three Kingdoms V offers many innovations. You won't only participate at wars, but also manage your country, and learn resource management of people and goods. A new "Reputation" parameter directly affects the people's opinion of you as the leader. Multiplayer allows participation of up to eight players (playing the eight main characters).<br><br>The game was never translated into English. It was released in Japan for the PC (both DOS and Windows), and for PlayStation. A Chinese translation of the game (DOS version) is available.

Description=The events of this game take place a few years after those described in the  first game. The new hero is Keith, a young owner of a restaurant in the capital city of Barran. However, he also has a second profession: thief. He only steals from evil people, following the Robin Hood-like tradition of his father, who dedicated years of his life to uncover the secret of a mysterious dungeon known as the Tower of Daidalos. Keith wants to follow in his father's footsteps and to unravel the mystery of the tower. One day he accidentally meets a beautiful young girl who has lost a precious gem. The charmed hero swears he would find it and bring it back. But he doesn't know that the disappearance of the gem is closely connected to the mystery of the Tower of Daidalos...<br><br>Romance wa Tsurugi no Kagayaki II shares many elements with its predecessor. While the exploration in the game is done in traditional Japanese RPG fashion, the battles resemble those of a turn-based strategy game, since the characters can move on the battle screen and can only attack when enemy is within the range of their weapons. There are no random battles in the game; all the enemies are visible on screen.<br><br>Like in the first game, the player is able to control the growth of characters, similarly to a Western RPG. Experience points can be accumulated, and leveling up is done manually by the player. Different character classes require different amount of XP to raise a corresponding attribute (for example, it costs less to raise a mage's magic power than stamina).<br><br>It is possible to imbue weapons with magical items to increase their powers and learn special weapon-related skills. There is also a dating system present in the game. The player can buy items for the female party members to increase their affection, and take them on specific sub-quests. This also influences the ending of the game.<br><br>Unlike the first game, Romance wa Tsurugi no Kagayaki II contains no nudity or sexual scenes, even though there is plenty of sexual innuendo in conversations and events.

Description=Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths & Legends is a game based on the animated TV series of the same name, basically X-Files for kids. The player takes the role of Nick Logan who has the unique ability to see through alien disguises and accompanies him during his work: catching aliens to save the world. The gameplay principle is simple: the player walks through 15 levels with a fixed camera perspective and shoots everything he sees, e.g. werewolves or vampires. To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn't kill his enemies for good: He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one button) or they regenerate.<br><br>Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g. activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to disable a bomb or open a lock: basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the correct button with the right timing. The levels are divided into five areas: London, Ireland, San Francisco, a Maya temple and Roswell.

Description=Saiyuki: Journey West is loosely based on one of the four classical novels of Chinese literature, Journey to the West (Chinese: Xi You Ji) by the 16th century writer Wu Cheng'en. This tactical RPG lets the players take the role of the novel's hero who is also a historical character, the 7th century scholar and Buddhist monk Xuanzang (Japanese pronunciation: Sanzo) and his monster companions, including the famous monkey Sun Wukong (Japanese pronunciation: Son Goku), as they travel to India. The game takes quite a few liberties with the original tale, including allowing the player to change Xuanzang's gender, giving each monster a more powerful "were-" form, and tying each character, save Xuanzang's, to an elemental affinity.<br><br>The real meat of the game is the tactical battles, where careful unit placement and use of each monster's unique special abilities determine the outcome of the battle.

Description="Saraba Yamato" is a game based on the famous japanese anime series "Uchû Senkan Yamato" (known as "Starblazers" in the US). More precisely, this particular game is based on the second series and movie (1978).<br><br>The time is 2201. It is one year after the Yamato successfully came back from the planet Iscandar. One day, earth receives a strange S.O.S. from deep space : the voice of a woman called Teresa, prisoner of the Comet Empire, warns Earth that the White Comet is on its way to the Solar System to enslave its inhabitants. But the Earth's Government doesn't want to believe her story. Fearing the upcoming danger, the crew of the Yamato reunites and decides to disobey their orders, eventually stealing their old ship (which was fated to become a museum) to rescue Teresa and stop the White Comet.<br><br>The game itself is a real-time tactical game. It mostly plays on a board with hexagons where you must move your ship and fight against the enemy. You must manage the crew of the Yamato to gain advantage during battles and uses special options as the "Warp Jump" or the legendary "Wave Motion Canon". When two ships come on the same hexagon, a "space battle" begins where you control directly your ship in space.<br><br>The game follows very closely the original story and features many animated cutscenes which are actually re-made scenes from the original anime - with 3D rendered space ships and new character-design by Keisuke Masunaga. As fans would expect, the story is one of the strong points of the game, with many turns and twists. There is even two different endings following the story as told in the series or in the movie.

Description=Enter a surreal world where you must battle the Sentinel and his sentries over 650 chequered, 3D landscapes.  Energy and movement are completely redefined in this unique blend of arcade and strategy elements. You, only known as an intelligent presence, move about the landscape by teleporting between robot "hulls".  Any object in your field of vision can be absorbed for energy, as long as you also see the square of the landscape that the object is standing on.  By aiming at any square your can see, and spending energy, you can create a new robot hull and teleport your presence to it, or you can create neutral objects: trees to block yourself from the Sentinel's gaze, or boulders that can be stacked.  You gain height in the landscape by creating a robot on top of a stack of boulders, until you can see the Sentinel's square at the highest point in the landscape and absorb him.  The problem is that the Sentinel slowly rotates and ruthlessly absorbs anything in his field of vision that is more potent than a tree, including yourself.  In later levels, his sentries will threaten you with absorption from several directions.

Description=Something is going wrong in the land of Arkose: cities destroy themselves, monsters attack innocent citizens, diseases spread among the people. A giant blast has destroyed a whole town, only a young guy named Stinger narrowly escaped death. Stinger engages himself on a quest to avenge his hometown's destruction. On his journey he meets the beautiful elven girl Windleaf and the robot Harv-5, who help him to reach his ultimate goal.<br><br>Although it all seems like a typical Japanese RPG, it is not. Shadow Madness was developed and produced in the USA, although, beyond any doubt, the Final Fantasy series has been the main source of inspiration here. The battles are random, like in many Japanese RPGs, and the battle system is almost the same like in Final Fantasy games: menu-based, with several sub-menu choices. The graphics are in 3D with polygonal characters in anime/manga style (what some people call "deformed").

Meaning that you move the aim as well as the character with the directional pad. There are also a few bonuses such as heavier weapons and bonus points to pick up.<br><br>G Squad has the player pilot a big mech robot. The only freedom of movement is strafing sideways to the left or right and some slight movement up and down. Aside from that the player controls the aim and can select from three different weapons to take down enemies with. There are also bonuses, such as ammo, extra points and fuel.<br><br>War Drones, Space Rebellion, IF22 and Air Rescue are all variants of the same theme. The player controls an airborne machine (airplane, jetfighter, mecha or spaceship, depending on the game), and takes down enemies in a similar fashion to the arcade classic Afterburner. There are two types of weapons to use: either a light rapid firing weapon (machine gun or laser, depending on the game) and rockets which are somewhat heat seeking.

You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.<br><br>There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.<br><br>Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.<br><br>There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.

Doing a correct formation will slow your descent, giving you more time to execute more tricks.  To perform a formation correctly you must correctly enter the button sequence displayed on the screen within a short period of time. If you do this correctly your four skydivers will move into the formation. Formations are performed in sequence; if you miss one you must return to the beginning of the sequence and start over. You try to do as many tricks as possible before your team falls too low and they must pull their parachutes.<br><br>You can also &quot;attack&quot; your opponent - by performing tricks successfully you fill up your attack meter.  When it is full you can execute an attack and force the other team to defend itself by performing a defensive formation. If the other team fails in its defense, it will fall at a higher rate of speed.

It's up to them, as well as many returning friends, to save to world, or what will be left of it anyways.<br><br>Gameplay in Slayers Royal takes place in a mixture of 2D town screens and 3D turn based battle arenas. In towns you can move between multiple areas as well as look at objects and people to examine or talk to them. Lina will often get into (occasionally voiced) conversations with her companions, and in most conversations choices can come up that determine if the party receives stat upgrades or money. In battle each character in the party can be controlled either manually, or left up to an automated AI. Most characters can use magic, but each spell has a wait time that prevents a character from casting more magic until enough turns have passed. Characters do not gain strength or money from battle, instead strength is determined by how rested and full the stomachs of the characters are before combat.

In combat the automatic turn system from the first game has been replaced with a more traditional one turn at a time. Terrain now has variable height, and can be raised or lowered with specific spells. Finally a spell's wait time is now reflected in the time it takes a character to cast a spell, making it possible to avoid a spell or attack a caster to prevent the spell from finishing.

You control one of the chosen ones who were destined to fight and destroy the Garan.<br><br>Gameplay is very much like Tenchu, in a 3rd person view, as you run around the streets of villages in search of magic power-ups and the different coloured crystals before the Garan find them for their power.<br><br> Fighting is also like Tenchu, as you engage enemies using your weapons to injure your opponents or to block their attacks. You also have magic as another weapon to use against them. Combos are easily achieved and different weapons work better, or not at all on some enemies, so magic must be used.

Description=Soukyugurentai, a top-down shooter created by the Japanese developer Raizing, uses an elaborate combination of pre-rendered and real-time 3D graphics as well as 2D pixel art.<br>The player is given a choice to control one of the three fighter ships of the JIN-SET Corporation Self-Defense Corps, all with strangely fish-themed names - S.O.Q. 004 Swordfish, S.O.Q. 010 Mackerel,and S.O.Q. 025 Scallop. Each ship comes with a unique, upgradable weapon system - Swordfish uses an all-around average rapid fire gun, Mackerel fires a weak laser and homing missiles, while Scallop obliterates foes with a narrowly-focused rail gun and a sub-cannon that fires in a direction opposite to the ship's motion. In addition to the primary weapons each ship carries a lock-on laser, activated by holding down the fire button.

The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.<br><br>The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.<br><br>Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.<br><br>The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.<br><br>The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.<br><br>There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.<br><br>The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.<br><br>There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.

Also different in this console adaptation is the change of gameplay perspective from first-person to third-person.<br><br>Before starting a mission, players select the ranger best suited to complete objectives, based on five classes: machine gunner, grenadier, rifleman, close quarters specialist, or sniper. Each class has different abilities, and access to specific weapons or items. Each type also has a certain encumbrance, but the equipment can be further customized based on the available options. Some of the included weapons are shotguns, grenades, tripwire mines, machine guns and sniper rifles, but also more general items such as nightvision goggles.<br><br>The missions are set in a forest in Siberia, snowy mountains in Bosnia, the desert in Iraq, mountains in North Korea, and the jungle in Vietnam. The radar is an important element during gameplay. When a ranger is shot at, the enemy position briefly lights up on the radar as a red dot. Killed enemies often leave behind medkits and additional item pick-ups such as ammunition.

He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.<br><br>Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.<br><br>Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.<br><br>There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.

FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being "convinced" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.<br><br>A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, and must keep moving at all times. Two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.<br>One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.<br><br>The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.

Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal "Jedi" engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.<br><br>The player takes control of Kyle Katarn; an Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance.  After a prologue mission where he steals the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his "Dark Troopers" - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.<br><br>Dark Forces features 14 substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the Star Wars trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer.  Every level has objectives for Kyle to complete (rare, for First Person Shooters of the period), ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it.  Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.<br><br>The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, and the game features Imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off, or directly replicating, John Williams' original film score.<br><br>Dark Forces is entirely a single-player campaign, and no multiplayer is included or supported.

Description=Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting series.<br><br>New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.<br><br>The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)

Description=Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.<br><br>The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. <br><br>World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).<br><br>Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)<br><br>Versus - Two human players battle it out. <br><br>Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.<br><br>Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).<br><br>Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.

Description=Street Fighter Collection 2 is the second title in the Collection series and it goes even further back to the classic days of Street Fighter II. <br><br>Included is the one that started it all, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, and the two improved editions, Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, known as Dash and Dash Turbo in Japan respectively.<br><br>Street Fighter II: The World Warrior features all the basic features that would be carried over to subsequent Street Fighter II editions. The original game features eight selectable characters, with Ryu and Ken being the only characters with identical moves. In the single-player tournament, the player faces the other seven main characters, before proceeding to the final four opponents, which are non-selectable boss characters. Matches can go up to ten rounds if there is no clear winner before making the player lose by default (in Champion Edition and onward, this is reduced to four rounds).<br><br>The most significant change to Street Fighter II: Champion Edition is the ability to play as the four boss characters, as well as allowing two players to select the same fighter, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode is increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork is redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds are recolored. Much of the gameplay is revised to balance the characters out.<br><br>Finally, Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting is a minor update released in response to the proliferation of modified bootlegs of Champion Edition. Released on December 1992 (eight months after Champion Edition), Hyper Fighting increases the game speed and adds new special techniques for some of the fighters such as Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport and Chun-Li's Kikoken. All of the characters receive new color schemes, with the new scheme becoming the default and the original color scheme as the alternate for all characters except M. Bison, who still uses his original color scheme as the default and the new scheme as the alternate.

Description=Loosely based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "Water Margins" (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai'an. The game is a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own father?<br><br>Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights.<br><br>The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.

Description=Super Match Soccer is an action oriented soccer simulation which has one major difference to other soccer games of its time: the pass system. Instead of the usual separate buttons for passing and shooting there are three levels of shooting intensity which depend on how long the button is pressed. Also there is no semiautomatic passing, the player has to aim himself. Aside that the match control is genre standard: button combinations result in tricks like back-heels or lobs and with the sprint button a player can run fast for a limited time.<br><br>By default the player controls the player which has the ball. But a optional mode enables the player to control just one soccer player. Playing modes are cups and leagues with 24 national teams which can be altered in the editor.

Description=A Tetris-like puzzle game featuring popular characters from many Capcom games.<br><br>Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.

There are also some blocks which have no color at all, and cannot be matched, as well as blocks with a rotating arrow on them, and can only be rolled in one direction. A block can be rolled up one level on top of another block, as long as there is open space next to it for the block to get to speed.<br><br>A time limit is imposed by the "borderline" which creeps up the tower. The borderline moves up one level every so often, and if it reaches the lowest incomplete level of the tower, the game is over.

Large combos also create additional new blocks when they are completed, making them essential on the more advanced levels.<br><br>There is also a puzzle mode where a preset assortment of blocks must have all of their faces cleared within a set number of steps.

After beating your seven rivals there are two Bosses to beat. There are three difficulty levels, and fight lengths and number of rounds can be varied.<br><br>Each limb's movement is controlled with a different button, making finding the right combos a matter of instinct and planning rather than experimentation. Pure martial arts inspire most of the moves. This was the first beat 'em up allowing you to dodge an opponent's attack, something made possible by the 3D perspective.

You are not only rewarded for stealth, but this time around on efficiency of movement. This extra feature increases the difficulty of achieving the better items, as you not only have to be quiet, but be direct and near perfect in your steps. <br><br>This time around, the stories of the two ninja (and the hidden third character) diverge greatly at places, making replay much more attractive. In addition, cutscenes using both the game engine and CGI give more story as you progress. Gone, however, is the soundtrack. <br><br>In addition to the story mode, there is a mission editor, which allows you to create maps and missions to both hone your skills and share.

As a result Toshinden 4 was "old school" for its time.<br><br>While Toshinden 4 models it's game play more off Toshinden 1 and Toshinden 2 than 3, it makes what is perhaps the biggest change in the series; it does away with nearly all of the 40+ characters that the series has built up and replaces them with 13 almost completely new characters; only 3 of Toshinden 4's cast have appeared in previous games.<br><br>But even they are notably different as Toshinden 4 takes place sometime after Toshinden 3 story wise, hence they have aged. The new cast has some pretty big links to the old cast however and many of their stories and bio's reference the old cast even though most aren't named directly (for instance Lancelot was sent to a certain French noble man to be toughened up, while Fen met a certain spear wielding warrior that his own fighting style is conveniently similar to).<br><br>Graphically, Toshinden 4 sacrifices detail for fluid animation and speed, to the point where the original Toshinden arguably looks better overall.<br><br>The combo system is once again redone; now the player can make a combo out of any combination of light and hard attacks (high, low and jumping) with the limits that they can only enter each attack once (i.e only one high light slash, one low hard kick etc) and once a hard attack has been inputted, no further light attacks can be entered into the combo. <br><br>Special attacks have also become more special, generally being considerably more dramatic and requiring more complex button combinations that the past games.<br><br>Toshinden 4 also tweaks the series overdrive attacks; now each character has at least two and the bar is split into three segments; one block is used per overdrive attack, though all three can be saved up to activate the new Kishin Kourin attack which bestows a considerable ability increase at the cost of health.<br><br>A simple parrying system has been added to Toshinden 4; the player can attempt to repel any weapon based attack or they can use a special counter attack that can counter almost anything, but uses up an overdrive block.<br><br>Toshinden 4 introduces multiple arena types to the series; for the first time there are arenas with no edges as well as the standard square and round arenas one can be knocked off for a ring out. Toshinden 4 also introduces a third type of arena to the series; collapsing arenas. As the match goes on holes randomly form in the arena (though warning is given as to where they are about to form). As if to compensate for this new arena type, it is no longer possible to fall off an edge of the ring unless you are hit off or accidently perform a move that takes you over the edge.<br><br>As well as the standard fighting aspect, Toshinden 4 also has seven time unlocked themed "mini games", that include breakout, air hockey and a dancing game.<br><br>There is also a comprehensive database mode to unlock that includes detailed information about every character, sound bites, a jute box and character design sketches including some rejected costumes.<br><br>As well as all these extras, Toshinden 4 has pretty much every fighting game mode out there.

You can play alone, or with a number of computer-controlled rivals. <br><br>At the beginning of the game, you (and your rivals) have a large terrain at your disposal. The terrain includes hills, rivers, lakes, bridges, industrial facilities and a lot of small towns. It is up to you to decide how to start building your empire. <br><br>The game is shown in isometric projection. An icon bar at the top of the screen allows you to bring up the map, see the stats, or construct stuff. <br><br>Maybe you can begin by connecting two towns with a road, building a vehicle depot somewhere next to the road, and setting up bus stops in both towns. Now just buy a bus (initially, there are just a few models available, but more buses appear with time), set its schedule, and watch as it goes between both bus stops, taking passengers and unloading them, earning you money. <br><br>You can also transport passengers by building train tracks, sea ports, or airports and then buying appropriate vehicles - trains, ferries, planes. <br><br>If you set up a station next to an industrial facility (such as a factory, a power plant or a farm), you can also transport various cargo, such as coal, livestock or wood, which allows you to earn much more money than transporting passengers. Of course, you'll have to buy special lorries and train cars if you'll want to deal with these. Most businesses offer certain types of cargo and are ready to pay for transporting other cargo to them; for example, a steel mill has a lot of steel to fill your cars, and will gladly accept iron ore if you have any. <br><br>Clicking on any of your vehicles brings up a small window where you can observe a live feed of what the vehicle is doing and look up its status. If anything important happens during the game (such as a particular station accepting its first vehicle), it is shown as a newspaper headline at the bottom of the screen.

Description=Kyumei-hen is a direct sequel to the  first  Twilight Syndrome game, continuing the spooky adventures of the three brave and reckless high-school girls: Yukari, Mika, and Chisato. The first mystery involves a girl named Sakura Himegami, who was killed in an accident many years ago; apparently, her ghost is still around somewhere. The trail leads to an abandoned path in the mountains; Mika decides to venture there, while the other two are going back to school at night, hoping to find more clues.<br><br>The gameplay is identical to that of the previous entry: the player navigates the digitized images of the girls over 2D backgrounds in a side-scrolling/third-person perspective manner, searching for clues, triggering scenes, and choosing responses and/or actions when prompted by the narrative. As in the first game, these choices may influence the course of the story, and lead to various endings of the chapters; reaching a &quot;bad&quot; ending prevents the player from continuing to the next chapter.

Description=The story of Twilight Syndrome: Saikai focuses on four Japanese teenagers: Yuri, her sister Masa, and their friends Atsushi and Aya. It all begins when the youngsters hear rumors about spirits contained in the school building. At night, Yuri and her friends go into the school and play a spirit-summoning game. Suddenly, real ghosts appear and scare the teenagers away. The next day, Yuri is almost ready to believe it was all a dream... but naturally it wasn't. The dark secrets of the lost souls are going to be revealed only to those which possess a special sense - the Twilight Syndrome..<br><br>The third entry in the  Twilight Syndrome series is also a horror adventure, sharing most gameplay elements with its predecessors. The gameplay here is very minimalistic: the player can navigate the 3D models of the heroes (several characters can be controlled at once, as a group) through the limited areas (also rendered in 3D), searching for clues and escaping from danger. There is no other interaction, no usable items, and no combat. <br><br>Dialogue and action choices will pop out during many situations. Some of these choices do not influence the narrative, while others might change the following dialogue, and also lead the young heroes to premature death.<br><br>An additional gameplay mode (beside the story mode) is free-roaming exploration for Yuri, who can explore the school and its surroundings at night and gather more stories from the ghosts she encounters.

At night, armed with nothing but a flashlight, the trio of heroines enters the dark school building, prepared to explore every corner, and investigate every urban legend they have heard of...<br><br>Tansaku-hen opens the  Twilight Syndrome horror adventure series, defining its stylistic traits and gameplay. The game is divided into chapters, each dedicated to a particular &quot;ghostly&quot; story. Unlike most Japanese-style adventures, there is physical character navigation in the game; the player moves digitized images of the three girls on 2D backgrounds, in a manner somewhat similar to side-scrolling games - though many areas feature a third dimension, like in Western third-person perspective adventures.<br><br>The gameplay consists of two activities only: walking and occasionally choosing a dialogue option and/or action, as prompted by the game's narrative. There is no other kind of interaction, no inventory, and no combat. Different choices may lead to different endings; the next chapter can be accessed only if the player has not attained the &quot;bad&quot; ending.<br><br>Twilight Syndrome: Tansaku-hen abandons the nearly omnipresent anime/manga graphical style of Japanese games in favor of digitized images and photos of real people.

In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice.  The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams.  The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.<br><br>National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests.  Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way.  This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result).  The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals.  Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded.  The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward.  The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals.<br><br>National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers.  The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once.  The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals.  Penalty shootouts settle ties.<br><br>Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.<br><br>8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition.

Description=In UFO: A Day in the Life, the player takes control of a little alien, who is sent by his superior (a creature known as "Mother") to retrieve over fifty aliens who were stranded in a regular apartment building on the Earth after a UFO crash. There is, however, one big problem: these aliens are invisible! The little hero must use a device named "Cosmic" in order to locate them; but even then, it is necessary to take a full picture of the alien so that the rescue team will know where to search.<br><br>So, how is it possible to take pictures of invisible beings?.. By carefully observing the environments and the behavior of humans and other animals. For example, if an animal appears to be afraid of something, there might be a chance an alien is nearby. Or, if something has changed in the scenery, perhaps an alien was at work there.<br><br>UFO is essentially a puzzle game with adventure elements (navigating a character). The hero must travel to different rooms in the apartment building at different times, trying to snap the perfect picture of the invisible alien. The player is given a time limit and a picture limit (ten pictures per visit). Afterwards, the hero has to return to Mother, who will eat the negatives (really), produce pictures, and then decide whether they are suitable or not. Each successfully taken photo opens a new area and/or a new time of the day in the apartment block.<br><br>UFO is  Love-de-lic's second game (after  Moon: Remix RPG Adventure). It shares a few stylistic traits and gameplay elements with its predecessor, such as the eccentric character design, the "gibberish" language with sub-titles, and the day/night cycle with character schedules as an important gameplay element.

Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:<br><br>1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.<br><br>2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.<br><br>3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.<br><br>4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.<br><br>5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...<br><br>6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.<br><br>Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.<br><br>During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

These include moving, attacking, or using their special power.  There is a underlying story that is never fully developed but, is revealed as the player progresses through each of the 12 regions of the Strategy mode for both the Arcanes and Teknos.<br><br>A great deal of strategy is required to win in Mayhem mode and Strategy mode.

Description=Valendra is a land that had undergone civil war. The end of which had birthed the parliament and several organizations to control the balance of power. Ashley Riot is a Riskbreaker agent, an elite one man investigator, for the Valendia Knights of Peace (VKP) who is investigating some strange occurrences. A cult of religious fanatics known as Müllenkamp, and their leader Sydney Losstarot, have seized the manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom. The events at the manor have sent Ashley on a quest to get to the bottom of what's going on, and travel into the catacombs that lead to the destroyed, yet magical city of Leá Monde. However Ashley is not the only person interested in the city, and other factions of the government, including parliament assigned Knights of the Crimson Blade and other VKP agents are pursuing their own agenda. <br><br>Combat is central to the game. The game runs in real time but when entering combat and attacking an enemy, the game is paused. A wireframe sphere showing the range of the currently selected weapon and detailed statistics on different body parts of the enemies within range.<br><br>The game features a range of weapons. Each weapon can be disassembled and reassembled in workshops scattered throughout the game, attaching gems for extra power. Weapons used constantly against the same type of enemy improve in power against them.<br><br>Ashley can also make use of Magic, Chain Abilities and Break Arts. Magic is broken into four groups, namely defense, combat, healing and status. Spells use up mana points and are sometimes more costly than useful. Chain Abilities allow Ashley to "chain together" consecutive hits against enemies. Break Arts are special skills learnt after repetitive use of a weapon type. Sacrificing some of the player's health, Break Arts can perform a high damage attack on an enemy.

Description=In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the battlefields of the gods.<br><br>The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions, swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them.<br><br>The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using "spiritual concentration" to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress that come at the end of each "chapter". The chapter system is one of the game's most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often absent from more traditional console RPGs.

Description=Vampire Hunter D for the PlayStation is based on the anime titled Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.  That anime is based on the novel title Vampire Hunter D: Demon Deathchase written by Hideyuki Kikuchi.  You play as D, the half-human / half-vampire whose sole mission in life is to hunt down and kill vampires.  The setting is not the distant medieval past, nor is it the mid-19th century, instead D's adventures are set in the far distant future, when humanity has nearly killed itself off by endless wars.  Rising from the scorched earth and assuming power in this desolate era are the timeless vampires.  They established a feudal system where they ruled over humans as nobles in Europe ruled over their peasants.  But after thousands of years the Vampires' power waned and humans revolted against their lords, and thus the class of Vampire Hunters were born.<br><br>In this particular story, D is employed by a rich family to retrieve their daughter from the vampire who kidnapped her.  He is not the only one trying to free her; a rival group of vampire hunters, the Marcus Brothers, are after the daughter and the bounty, regarding D as a rival.  The Vampire Hunter D must enter Castle Chaith, battle the Vampire Lord, the minions that inhabit the castle, and a hidden evil, to save the girl and collect his bounty.<br><br>The action in Vampire Hunter D plays like the early Resident Evil games for the PlayStation.  There are pre-rendered backgrounds and all the characters are animated in 3D.  Players utilize D's signature weapon, his massive long sword, as well as his special vampire powers, (which comprise healing, offensive, and defensive powers), to battle the hordes of evil creatures that live in the hallways and chambers of the daemonic Castle Chaith.  You must solve puzzles, unlock doors, and retrieve key items to progress into the depths and heights of the castle, ultimately reaching and revealing the true evil power pulling the strings of this macabre story.

Description=In 1995 the increased power of the new wave of systems made 3D football games a possibility several companies investigated. Most of the features people later took for granted in football games were pioneered, or at least fairly fresh, when they appeared in the first of the Actua Sports titles.<br><br>Multiple camera angles were available to view the full-3D action, with 3 Sheffield Wednesday FC players providing motion capture. 44 international squads of 22 players each were featured, each with 8 individual skill attributes. BBC commentator Barry Davies provided a full flowing commentary over the top. A full range of customised tournaments were available, as were multi-player options allowing for both same-system and networked play.

Description=Inspired by the 1980s movie about a computer trying to take over the world, this action/strategy game allows you to field either the tanks of human NORAD or the walkers of AI-controlled WOPR, in warzones across the world.<br><br>You control one vehicle and can cycle through all the units in your current army at any time, and there are limited commands you can issue to the rest of your army. For example, you can tell all the units in your army to follow your vehicle. However this can be unreliable due to poor pathfinding.<br><br>There is a huge range of vehicles available for each army, from reconnaissance jeeps and bikes through heavy tanks and walkers all the way to the really special toys, laser and stealth tanks. There are air and sea assault troops available as well.<br><br>You receive your mission objectives in e-mails sent from mission control (or WOPR itself) which update as you fulfill briefs. These can be as simple as 'go there, kill that' but sometimes require more complex tasks such as picking up a spy from behind enemy lines, crippling a base's SAM sites to allow an attack from the air, and so on.<br><br>One major draw of the game is an enjoyable two-player co-operative mode. Using a unique split-screen view (split diagonally instead of vertical/horizontal) both players control a vehicle each, and can cycle through the rest. This can be interesting as one player lends air support while the other storms the AA sites with a tank, for example.<br><br>In addition to co-operative mode, there is a head-to-head multiplayer mode available and about 30 levels in the single player mode.

As you make your way across the wasteland, hunting down artifacts and destroying hostile forces, you find out that the satellite's unexpected nuclear launch may not have been entirely accidental after all...<br><br>You are in charge of searching the land for technological artifacts held by the other fellows.  These artifacts are then researched to create new weapons, chasses, and propulsion types, all of which are interchangable, meaning there are over 2000 units for you to blow stuff up with.  You can build tanks, hovercraft, Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) vehicles, as well as cyborg units.  There are machine guns, missile launchers, flame throwers, mortars, etc.  Since all your technology comes from artifacts you swipe from your enemies, you are almost always fighting with weapons a step below what the other guy has, meaning you have to rely on your strategic prowess instead of sheer military superiority.  The battlefield is fully 3D, the camera is rotatable and zoomable, and all units are 3D as well, except for humans, which are sprites, but they aren't too plentiful, so it's a minor point.

The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level arent always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything youd logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy this reduces the significance of the points system.

Description="Wild Arms 2" isn't really a sequel to Sony's original title. Your hero, a young soldier Ashley, is transformed to a demon. Ashley is determined to purge the evil from his body. He meets Brad, a criminal and a war-hero, and Lilka, a female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater conspiracy has taken place...<br><br>The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members learn while progressing in the game. <br><br>"Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera) contain many puzzles to solve.

You walk along a vertically scrolling platform while shooting enemies. You can grab power-ups such as stronger shot, or an option that follows you and shoots. The gameplay is very similar to Ghosts 'N Goblins (also by Capcom). If you get hit you even lose your clothes and walk in you underwear in the same way.<br><br>Chariot - Adventure Through The Sky<br><br>Chariot is a shoot'em-up similar to Gradius. You shoot enemies on a vertically scrolling screen, collect power-ups and fight end bosses. You collect power-ups such as three-way shot, stronger laser, extra points, options and a shield. If you pick up extra options, they attach to you like a tail. The end bosses are themed after the classic elements, like the wind and moon and sun etc.<br><br>Don't Pull (donpuru)<br><br>Don't Pull is essentially a polished and updated version of Pengo. In this single screen game, you play as a bunny or chipmunk walking through a maze full of baddies. You can push the blocks of the maze to crush the enemies.<br><br>If you push a tile which is blocked by another tile, you will crush it to clear your way through the maze. There also are special blocks, for example if you push a block with a bomb icon, it explodes and stuns any nearby enemies. You get bonus points for crushing multiple enemies with a single block push.

Having become rich and properous in the previous game by collecting treasures, Torneko eventually recovered the "Joy Chest" from the very bottom of the dungeon and had it enshrined at his shop. Peace had returned to the town for some time. After awhile, a mysterious stranger arrived and seemed concerned about the Joy Chest being outside the dungeon. At the same time, monsters started reappearing and different parts of the kingdom began turning into "mysterious dungeons". It will be up to middle-aged Torneko, to fight through these strange places and help the king discover what has broken the peace.<br><br>Like other Fushigi no Dungeon games, Torneko: The Last Hope is a dungeon crawler viewed from the overhead. The dungeons are randomly generated. When venturing into dungeons, Torneko will find many items and fight monsters. He can freely move through the dungeons, but each movement or action of his is countered by those of the monsters (if they are present on screen). All actions are made in turns, so despite the illusion of walking and fighting in real time, the game is turn-based. There are all kinds of items in the dungeons including herbs which can be eaten or thrown, magic scrolls which can be read, swords and shields that can be equipped and staffs which can be waved until their charges are depleted. Players must also keep an eye on Torneko's hunger meter and eat regularly, otherwise Torneko will go into starvation and start losing hitpoints at a great rate.<br><br>There are several ways to leave a dungeon including death, an Outside Scroll, donating to a Priest or reaching the very bottom floor. When leaving the dungeon areas, Torneko's experience points and stats are lost. To make money, he must sell items he has collected from the dungeon, but may keep a couple of his items in the Storage Room for later use. Torneko's village initially starts small, but as progress in made in the game more and more services and shops will be attracted to it. Some examples of services include a Bread Baker, a Witch, a Blacksmith, a Builder and a Meldersmith.

Description=The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WORMNET. <br><br>For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. <br><br>Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.<br><br>Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.

Description=The UFOs are invading our skies! Reports of human and bovine abductions are increasing daily! Cities are terrorized! Something must be done!<br><br>XCOM, or eXtraterrestrial COMbat unit, was founded as an international force to combat the alien menace. Start with one base, two fighters, one transport, and a few soldiers, you must stop the alien threat... once and for all.<br><br>X-COM: UFO Defense is a strategy game featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can't afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished... <br><br>You can earn money by selling unneeded stuff, and you receive funding from the nations of the world; however, a nation can decrease its funding if it decides you aren't operating efficiently enough within its region. It's even possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the aliens and ceases funding altogether. <br><br>Once you join a ground battle, the game switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched.<br><br>In combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though). <br><br>The game aims to mix strategic considerations, resource management, and tactical combat considerations, along with plenty of authentic UFO lore.

Description=Xenocracy is a cross between a space combat action sim and a political strategy game with a unique premise.  In the far future, four planetary superpowers (the Earth Dominion, the Mercury League, the Venus Alliance and the Mars Combine) are vying for control of the solar system and on the brink of all-out "thermostellar war".  As commander of the United Planet Nations peacekeeping fighter squadron, your role is to maintain the balance and prevent cold war and localized conflicts from escalating into open interplanetary hostilities.  Further complicating the matter, you must deal with pirates and a looming alien threat.<br><br>As each planetary superpower launches low-intensity strikes (as opposed to open warfare) against the colonies and outposts of the other three, you are presented with the choice, via a strategic solar system map showing flaring geopolitical hotspots, of which to aid.  If you aid one superpower too much at the expense of the others, as one is first tempted to do, you upset the balance and cause the war you sought to prevent.  Whichever you choose, afterward you are realistically presented with complaints and political propaganda from the other three superpowers, and receive news broadcasts concerning the interplanetary geopolitical wrangling.<br><br>In addition to keeping the peace, you also manage research and development of newer and more powerful technologies, which will eventually prove crucial.  Several fighter and weapon types are available, and the scenery varies from asteroid belts and dust clouds to planetary surfaces.  You may choose from several wingmen, each with a personal description and personality type, whom you must do your best to keep alive.  Missions include such tasks as defending mine complexes from attack (or attacking them) and protecting convoys (or destroying them).<br><br>Xenocracy also allows Arcade Mode, in which you simply fly missions without regard to the strategic aspects of the game, and multiplayer games of up to 8 players over TCP/IP or serial connections.

The arcade giant returns with all of the characters and moves, with all the animation intact including the option to swap characters on the fly. This title required the 4 meg ram cart that shipped with it (although there were a few released without it), but once running, was practically arcade perfect. Zero loading times after the initial start-up load screen, and then instantly into the action.

Description=A young man named Yukiya goes on a yacht travel together with a few friends. Suddenly, a terrible storm comes out of nowhere: Yukiya is washed out on the shore. He regains consciousness, but not memories of recent events. Realizing that he is on an island, he begins to explore it and reaches a big mansion. To his surprise, his friends are already there; apparently, they have all been invited. Thinking that the worst is behind, Yukiya goes to sleep. But the next day, the young and beautiful owner of the mansion, Chiori Nakamura, is found dead in a locked room. One of Yukiya's companions reveals herself as the famous detective Edogawa Ranko (perhaps  Conan's older sister; definitely a reference to the Japanese crime novel author Edogawa Ranpo). Under her guidance, the group decides to investigate the murder, but it turns out that the mansion is cut off the rest of the world. They are stuck on the island, and one of them might be a murderer...<br><br>Yakata: Nightmare Project is an RPG with detective/mystery thematics rarely seen in games of its genre. Unlike most RPGs, it is set in an isolated environment; much of the gameplay is dedicated to exploration of the huge mansion and its surrounding, with conversation and event-triggering reminiscent of Japanese adventure games.<br><br>The game is done in 3D, the exploration process featuring third-person perspective movement with automatically adjusted camera angles. It is also possible to physically move on the island map (also in 3D), accessing locations displayed on it. <br><br>The actual RPG system is quite simple, with traditional random enemy encounters and turn-based mechanics. Battles take place on separate isometric screens. The combat distinguishes itself from other representatives of the genre by having offensive and defensive turns. During a defensive turn, the player can choose to defend, reducing the damage, or move to another place on the battle screen, hoping to avoid the attack.<br><br>Anime-style full-motion movie are used to advance the story. The most important dialogues feature voice acting.

Yakinikubugyo puts you in the role of a BBQ chef, and it's your job to make sure the customers leave happy and full from your restaurant.<br><br>The goal of each stage in the game is to make sure you keep all 3 customers happy when the timer runs out by handing out the right food to the right person, while making sure it's not undercooked or burned to a black piece of coal. The customers each have a food they like and one they hate, and they can suddenly change their minds in the middle of a stage, so figuring out what they want to eat and when is the key to success. You can also earn combos by feeding the same customer several times in a row with food they like.<br><br>You use chop sticks to maneuver around a 3x4 squares big grill where you have to put down pieces of meat and vegetables and grill them to perfection. The closer to the middle of the grill you put the food, the faster it cooks, so if you have a customer yelling at you to hand him/her something, you can put the food there.<br><br>If you're too slow or forget about a piece of food, it slowly turns to coal and you have to tap it to clean the grate.

Description=Yellow Brick Road is an action adventure title inspired by the Oz Books by L. Frank Baum.  The game concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King.  Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow.  Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz.  The game is short and ends in a cliff hanger designed to lead into the next chapter, Yellow Brick Road II.  However, that game was never localized outside of Japan.<br><br>The adventure portion is kept to a minimum, primarily designed to advance the plot to the next battle without any real puzzles to speak of.<br><br>The battles are the meat of the game and they are fairly unique.  The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions.  Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game.  The more powerful items act differently depending on who uses them.  For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again.  This is important as enemies progress toward the companions side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them the battle is lost and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field the battle is won and the game progresses.  Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations and against some are immune.  Trial and error combined with quick reflexes and a good strategy of making sure not all of the characters are recuperating at the same time is the only way to succeed.

Where the biggest change lies, of course, is in the transition from the text parser to an interface controllable by a console's joystick.  Adapting some sentence-construction conventions from the graphical adventure game genre (and the interfaces of Lucasfilm's and Legend's early entries in particular), menus selectable with a joystick pointer fill in for common "action" verbs while icons represent the inventory items the verbs influence; an expanded compass rose permits precise navigation of the Flatheadian ruins. (Alas!  No secret joystick-button combination for "xyzzy"!)<br><br>In short: as faithful a reproduction of the original experience as you're going to find without employing a keyboard or voice-recognition software, plus "modern" graphics, sound and music!
