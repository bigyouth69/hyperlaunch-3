Description=3x3 Eyes: Kyuusei Koushu S is an enhanced version of the game 3x3 Eyes: Kyuusei Koushu  for Windows 3x and Playstation.<br><br>The game is based on the manga/animé series 3x3 Eyes (Sazan Eyes, as it is pronounced in Japanese). Long time ago, a group of people in ancient China discovered the secret of immortality. But they paid a high price for it. A "third eye" appeared on their faces: once it opened, it unleashed a devastating magic power from within them. The Sanjiyan (three-eyed ones) became powerful demon-like creatures. But one of them, a girl named Pai, wanted to become human again. She met a Japanese explorer and scientist who was willing to help her, but he died in a tragic accident, and Pai had no choice but to team up with his son, an ordinary Japanese teenager named Yakumo. Reluctantly, Yakumo helps Pai, because through a bizarre accident he also has lost his human essence, and wants to get it back at any cost...<br><br>The story of the game is based on the following episode: Yakumo receives a message from his friend, the Buddhist monk Naparvha, saying that a curse has fallen upon a village in China. A young girl was killed under mysterious circumstances, and two monks fell asleep and cannot wake up. Yakumo visits the village and begins the investigation, aided by Yue Hua, the sister of the dead girl. <br><br>The game is a Japanese adventure, similar to Eve Burst Error. All the locations are pre-rendered still shots, and you interact with the environment by choosing options from the menu (such as "Look", "Talk", "Move", etc.). There are no real puzzles in the game, which plays like an interactive animé more than like a "true" adventure. <br><br>This enhanced version for Saturn includes new animated sequences, new voice recording, better graphics, and an extra "Making Of" CD.

Description=The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous  Variable Geo games: the strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. <br><br>Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the eight heroines is available as a playable character in these modes. The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches.

Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.<br><br>Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).<br><br>Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. <br><br>Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark.

Url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-saturn/amok
Description=Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.<br><br>Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.<br><br>The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.

The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).<br><br>The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas.

Description=In this game, the player assumes the role of an ordinary Japanese young man who works in a restaurant. One day he comes home and finds seven strange creatures sitting at his table and discussing something you have no clue about. But before you decide to throw the uninvited guests out of your apartment, a beautiful green-haired woman appears. This is the goddess Swatty, and she has power over the Seven Lucky Gods, which the mysterious seven creatures turn out to be. Swatty feels pity for the lonely hero, and decides to help him to find a girlfriend.<br><br>Can Can Bunny Premier is the fourth installment in the  Can Can Bunny series. Compared to its predecessors, it is the most pure Japanese-style adventure, without the strategy parts of the  previous game.

At several points it is possible to branch the story line, which mostly influences the amount of success the hero has had with a girl.

There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items.

Description=Clockwork Knight is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys. Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.<br><br>The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.<br><br>Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.

You are used to orders of hunting down the Resistance, a ragtag band of rebels committing sabotage and other acts of terrorism against the WEC, but slowly, you realized the WEC is not quite what it appears to be... then one day you and two other Silencers, your best buddies, were ambushed by a WEC mech patrol when it was supposed to be a routine mission. You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance... <br><br>Crusader: No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You're up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don't). You'll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there's usually a bit of puzzle involved.

Featuring eight athletes with different abilities and specialties, from the agile Karl Vain and Femi Kadiena, the fast Li Huang and Ellen Reggiani, the well balanced Joe Kudou and Rick Blade to the powerhouses Aleksei Rigel and Jef Jansens, the player must achieve the best scores possible in each event to get to the World's best results table, not only in the decathlon points table but also on the individual events table.<br><br>All events follow the core gameplay of other athletics titles (such as Track & Field), with some changes from event to event. Spriting events such as the  100-meter dash are pure button-bashing, with the 110-Meter Hurdles requiring an additional tap in the action button to pass the athlete at the correct time over the hurdle without losing speed or knocking it down. At the opposite level, the 400-Meter and the 1500-Meter Race add a stamina bar that must be kept above critical levels at all times to keep the athlete fresh until the end, this being done by simply pacing the number of presses done by the player (the 1500M also requires the player to steer the athlete in the best path: as close as possible to the inside edge without hitting other runners or losing speed from going over the edge). Jumping events, along the javelin, require a fast build-up, an well-timed action (be it jump, set the pole or release the javelin), and setting the most appropriate angle. Discus is the only event where button mashing isn't required, and asks the player to rotate the D-pad clockwise to build strenght, followed by a push of the action button to set the angle of release as well as the direction. <br><br>Like in the original ST-V version (which means it is in every way similar to the arcade version), two players can compete at the same time in the running event, and at the 1500M race six drones compete at the same time.

Description=Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu is a game that adds another Dragon Ball to the franchise of the same name and starts with the events of the Saiyan Saga and the fight with Vegeta and Nappa.<br><br>In Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu you don’t have your natural one on one fights. At the beginning of each fight you are given a total of 4 fighters (up to 6 later) from which you have to choose the 3 that you would like to participate in the battle that follows. Each fighter has 2 bars – a green and a yellow one. The green represents the life force and the yellow the power force which is depleted with every attack you do. At the bottom of the screen there is a blue bar and a red one that form a gauge called Power Balance. The reason for this gauge to be there is because your attacks don’t affect the enemies’ life bar directly. By continuously attacking the enemy the bar that represents your power (blue bar) increases while that of the enemy (red bar) decreases. When the blue bar covers all the gauge a random attack sequence, from the current character you’re controlling, is initiated and that’s how you can actually injure your opponents. The same can happen to you though if the enemy’s red bar covers all the gauge.

Description=Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter.  The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay.  <br><br>In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers.

Other options are unlockable while playing the game.<br><br>One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.<br><br>This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.

All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.<br><br>While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw. <br><br>Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.<br><br>Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.<br><br>Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a camera.

Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.<br><br>The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.

Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.<br><br>The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.

The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.<br><br>Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.<br><br>Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.<br><br>Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:<br><br>- A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.<br><br>- Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>- Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.

Description=Treasure's unique scrolling beat-em-up/RPG hybrid, Guardian Heroes introduces the player to a motley crew of heroes (Consisting of a swordsman, a ninja, a cleric and a mage), formed to find a "legendary sword". The game begins with the heroes in a bar, having found this sword, as they decide what to do with it. Before they have a chance to come up with an idea however, they are interrupted as an Imperial General charges in and warns them they are in grave danger. Seconds later, Imperial troops swarm into the inn and the heroes are forced to take flight along with this general.<br><br>The fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than the average scrolling beat-em-up, with light and heavy attacks, special moves (executed the same way you'd expect a normal beat-em-up to work), magical attacks and the ability to block. As you defeat enemies you gain experience points, with which you can upgrade your character between levels - sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.<br><br>Even more interesting however is the hugely branching storyline, which changes according to decisions you make (of which there are many) and which character you select to play with.<br><br>Also of note is the fact that even in one-player mode there are always two of you on screen - you command the other character by changing his "mood" - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is possible to play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six players/bots, and in this mode you can play as any character that you have encountered during the main game mode.

There are voice-overs for all story-related dialogues in this version.<br><br>There is also another significant change: the original GunBlaze had scenes with nudity; GunBlaze S has none.

Description=Gun Frontier is a 1990 arcade vertical shoot-'em-up based on the animated series of the same name. The setting of the series and purportedly of the game is an extraterrestrial American Wild West, with the player fighting to defend settlers from airborne pirates -- the game, though, actually looks to be an entirely standard military-themed shooter, with the player's jet fighter set against tanks and other airplanes. Guns and bombs are levelled-up and collected by dropped power-ups, which are money-themed, with the gun upgrades shown as American dimes and bombs as gold bars.<br><br>Gun Frontier was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and was later included in the cross-platform compilation Taito Legends 2 in 2006.

Description=Pilot an enormous walking mech to complete missions set all over the world in late 21st century warfare fighting other mechs, trucks and helicopters. The missions, set in different weathers and at different times of day, usually have specific objectives, be they search and destroy, protecting allies or killing everything. Four weapons are available: the main cannon; a weak machine gun that overheats with prolonged use; clusters of grenades and limited supplies of homing missiles. Damage repair and extra ammo is available from supply helicopters, but these are vulnerable to attack. Ally mechs can be useful, but it is the player who has to do most of the work by far, battling mechs that are sometimes faster and more agile, therefore a certain amount of strategy and planning is required.

However, in the name of self-defense, Goa Del began to develop weaponry against the wishes of the house of lords, El Doral, and eventually war broke out between the two groups. The queen of El Doral sent her young daughter Rabis on a shuttle to Earth, but in an attack, the shuttle was separated from the convoy and made an emergency landing on the moon. In a last-ditch effort, El Doral brought the way to an end with the "organic weapon" HN-01, and the defeated Goa Del fled into the reaches of space.<br><br>Two thousand years later, the descendants of Goa Del, now calling themselves the Baskille Empire, are rapidly expanding their power.

Description="Hattrick Hero S" reminds us of the side-scrolling arcade soccer games in 2D that were popular in the coin-ops of the 90's, especially of the Super Sidekicks series. In this game we can choose among a large list of national teams (42 in total) from all the continents, and we can compete in either a friendly match, a championship, a world league or a penalty shoot out session. Each team counts with an "Ace" player (you can guess who he is by seeing "Ace" above his head during a match), or in other words, the man with the best skills in the team. The game also counts with a system that lets you execute special actions during a match, but these have to be "exchanged" for something called units (you start every match with 20 of them), so for example, if you want to execute an Hyper Shoot (the most effective shoot in the game) you will have 6 units less. These actions must be executed by your "Ace", and he can be as far as the area as he wants, because in all cases the shoot will still be almost unstoppable.

All of Heretic's innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage.  Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.<br><br>The hub system steps away from the traditional "single levels stringed along into episodes" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single "hub" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the "spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.<br><br>Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.

There are six hover cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to choose from, which change the colour of the vehicle: Mad Medicine (white), Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks (orange), DethFest (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).

Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!<br><br>There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.<br><br>This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:<br>Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons<br>2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.<br>3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles<br>4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon<br>5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...<br>6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.<br>7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.<br>8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.<br>9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger<br>10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead<br>11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.<br>12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.<br>13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful<br>14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.<br>15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.<br>16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.

During the summer break, Kentarou has been working in a restaurant, run by a relative of his family. Now the summer is over, so Kentarou can finally get his salary and prepare for the school season that is about to begin. With some money in his pocket, and plenty of interest towards representatives of the fairer sex, the boy is determined to make this school year memorable...<br><br>The game is a so-called love adventure, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game with a heavy emphasis on dating, similar to  Dokyusei, another popular game of that kind by  Elf. The word "kakyusei" means "student(s) from a lower grade", which in its turn means that younger girls are the primary "dating focus" of the game. However, it is also possible to date other women beside the hero's schoolmates, including even a teacher.<br><br>The gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dokyusei: the player navigates Kentarou through the top-down city, visiting locations that are presented as still screens viewed from first-person perspective. The game has an internal clock, and each visit advances it, so that the number of activities that can be done during one day is limited. Kentarou must usually wait for the next weekend or vacation to be able to explore the city freely.<br><br>The game offers a considerable amount of freedom in exploration, and the possibility to visit diverse locations, such as museum, cinema, parks, game arcades, etc. Kentarou can earn and pend money, buying items that can be given to a girl on a date. The dating mechanics, however, are not very complex, mostly involving being at the right place at the right time, and choosing appropriate answers to impress the girl.<br><br>The game features scenes with nudity and sexual situations.

Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll past and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent "Super Desperation Move" (or SDM) at any time provided the character has at least two full bars of charged energy stored.

Description=The Story of Thor 2 is the prequel to the game The Story of Thor on the Genesis/Mega Drive. The game is played from a top down perspective similar to most RPGs that graced the 2D consoles such as Zelda or Shining Force. You play a character who, along with being able to kick and slash his way about the place, also can use the powers of six elemental spirits (fire, water etc.) to both destroy bad guys and solve various puzzles.<br><br>The game features high-resolution 2D graphics which are much improved over its Genesis counterpart and CD quality audio. It really shows off the 2D capabilities of the Saturn system. The gameplay itself is not all that much different from the first game however and doesn't really expand the RPG components of the game. This series is very much an action-oriented RPG game.

Description="Machi" literally means "district", "city area". The game was called by their creators a sound novel. <br><br>The idea of the game is to let the players experience five days in the lives of eight different characters. They all live somewhere in the city, each one preoccupied with his (or her) own problems. Their paths might cross without them realizing it. At any point in the game, you can switch between characters, but when you do so, the day or the time of the day of the other character corresponds to the one you are currently having. <br><br>The eight protagonists are: Keima Amemiya, a policeman; Jintaro Umabe, an actor; Masami Ushio, a gang member; Yoshiko Hosoi, without a particular profession (the only female protagonist in the game); Masashi Shinoda, a student; Ryuji Takamine, a deserter; Fumiyasu Ichikawa, a writer; and Yohei Tobisawa, a high-school boy. You control the characters by making decisions for them: where to go next, how to answer to another character, etc. In many cases, there are wrong decisions which lead to a premature end (bad ending). The story is presented through text (without voices) and still shots of live actors and locations, with occasional short animated sequences.

The game has 50 levels, called "worlds"; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to "restore the equilibrium" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level. <br><br>To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it "yours". To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect "your" mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the "castle" spell at it to make it bigger. <br><br>The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors. <br><br>There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses.

Description=An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.<br><br>id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.<br><br>In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.<br><br>Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.<br><br>The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.<br><br>Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

Description=This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. <br><br>There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.<br><br>There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.<br><br>If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.<br><br>The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.

Description=Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.<br><br>Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of "boss" robot is put in your way. These "bosses" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!<br><br>The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.

But the world faces a deadly threat: a dark cult wishes to destroy Japan and the very world itself. To combat any possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together 6 young ladies from around the world to form the Hanagumi (Flower Bridage) division of the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group). Clad in their proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers, but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.<br><br>And, with a single letter, young Navy ensign Ichirou Ohgami's life is about to take a very interesting turn...as the chosen leader of the Hanagumi! Ohgami now has to gain the trust of the members of the Hanagumi if he expects to keep things under control.<br><br>The gameplay of "Sakura Taisen" is a combination of Japanese-style adventure, "dating simulation", and strategic turn-based combat. Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, to which your military base is disguised. Depending on your decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time limit for responses) - you'll develop different relationships with the girl, which will influence not only further dialogues and the ending, but also their parameters in battles. During combat, you navigate your hero and the girls over the field and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn you can perform two different actions, and your walking distance, as well as attack range, is limited and unique to each character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment.

Description=You play the game as Scud, a "disposable assassin", who has been hired to take out a target in the "Marvin's Manikan" factory.  Based on the underground comic by Rob Schrab, Scuds are designed to self destruct after they have destroyed their target... Scud has become aware of this fact, and instead only injures his target enough to not self-destruct.  But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original target's life support.<br><br>The game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other compatible light gun).  With a controller, the game is a side scrolling shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first person shooter.  You can play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially meant to be played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns).<br><br>The game is fueled by music from "DJR/IB3 LTD." (Darryl J. Reavis &amp; Illuminado Berrios, III), Fidget-X, and Unbelievable Jolly Machine

Description=After Virtua Racing, Daytona USA and Sega Rally, yet another classic SEGA arcade racer (this time, from the Model 2C CRX architecture) is converted for home users. After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega. <br><br>Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an "Arcade" and a "PC"/"Saturn" mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player.<br>As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.<br><br>Another feature was the "Global Ranking" mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only "Global Net Events".

Description=Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.<br><br>The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences. <br><br>The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique "friendship" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.<br><br>It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline.

Description=Maxis takes their Sim-building line vertical with SimTower, an original concept from Japan (where vertical living is much more commonplace than in many parts of the world). <br><br>Your goal is to build a skyscraper that is both tall, aethestically pleasing, popular, and, most importantly, economically profitable. To be successful, your building cannot just be levels upon levels of officespace, or just an apartment sky-rise, but a multi-functional haven for humanity featuring everything from penthouses to theatres, restaurants to shopping malls. The centerpiece of your tower design is your elevators and proper managment is the key.<br><br>You can watch your Sims enter and leave your grand tower, getting impatient waiting for elevators, or having a hectic work day at the office. You can even train in on one or two, to server as a metering stick for their compatriots, or just to peek into the average workday of the little people living in your building. Or watch the security and resuce crews race as distasters like bomb threats and fires rampage through your well-crafted skyscraper.

It's up to them, as well as many returning friends, to save to world, or what will be left of it anyways.<br><br>Gameplay in Slayers Royal takes place in a mixture of 2D town screens and 3D turn based battle arenas. In towns you can move between multiple areas as well as look at objects and people to examine or talk to them. Lina will often get into (occasionally voiced) conversations with her companions, and in most conversations choices can come up that determine if the party receives stat upgrades or money. In battle each character in the party can be controlled either manually, or left up to an automated AI. Most characters can use magic, but each spell has a wait time that prevents a character from casting more magic until enough turns have passed. Characters do not gain strength or money from battle, instead strength is determined by how rested and full the stomachs of the characters are before combat.

In combat the automatic turn system from the first game has been replaced with a more traditional one turn at a time. Terrain now has variable height, and can be raised or lowered with specific spells. Finally a spell's wait time is now reflected in the time it takes a character to cast a spell, making it possible to avoid a spell or attack a caster to prevent the spell from finishing.

Seven levels separate Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik.<br><br>Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left and right. <br><br>Gameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue tokens. <br>Unlike all other previous games, time isn't a requirement: if the player completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.

Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)

Description=Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli.

The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).<br><br>Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)<br><br>Versus - Two human players battle it out. <br><br>Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.<br><br>Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).<br><br>Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.

Description=Street Fighter Collection 2 is the second title in the Collection series and it goes even further back to the classic days of Street Fighter II. <br><br>Included is the one that started it all, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, and the two improved editions, Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, known as Dash and Dash Turbo in Japan respectively.<br><br>Street Fighter II: The World Warrior features all the basic features that would be carried over to subsequent Street Fighter II editions. The original game features eight selectable characters, with Ryu and Ken being the only characters with identical moves. In the single-player tournament, the player faces the other seven main characters, before proceeding to the final four opponents, which are non-selectable boss characters. Matches can go up to ten rounds if there is no clear winner before making the player lose by default (in Champion Edition and onward, this is reduced to four rounds).<br><br>The most significant change to Street Fighter II: Champion Edition is the ability to play as the four boss characters, as well as allowing two players to select the same fighter, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode is increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork is redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds are recolored. Much of the gameplay is revised to balance the characters out.<br><br>Finally, Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting is a minor update released in response to the proliferation of modified bootlegs of Champion Edition. Released on December 1992 (eight months after Champion Edition), Hyper Fighting increases the game speed and adds new special techniques for some of the fighters such as Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport and Chun-Li's Kikoken. All of the characters receive new color schemes, with the new scheme becoming the default and the original color scheme as the alternate for all characters except M. Bison, who still uses his original color scheme as the default and the new scheme as the alternate.

As a pilot for the Thunder Force group, it's up to you to destroy an evil alien race bent on destroying the Earth and all of its inhabitants. As in its predecessors, the gameplay is fast and furious, with more powerful weapons. All weapons now have an extra powerful blast mode, triggered by holding down the fire button. Sprites have been forfeited in favour of 2D polygons made possible by the new platform. The musical score contains a lot of techno rearrangements of old Thunder Force themes. In spite of all the changes, Thunder Force V aims to please fans of old-schoolers by not abandoning concepts and details introduced in earlier games in the series.

Description=It is 22th century. Human beings have long reached the outer space and traveled to other planets. But they could not find happiness, and soon their only source of feelings became the "Cyber Net", a virtual world where people could experience simple emotions such as love or hatred. One day, a deadly virus was discovered in the Cyber Net. A special unit called Blue Metal was sent to annihilate the virus. But something went wrong, and the members of the unit were killed. Serge Shadix survived, but his brother Leon never came back. This accident made Serge join a force called STAND (Special Team for Alert to Network Destruction), which specialized in cybernetic crimes. Will Serge be able to solve the mystery and to discover the secret of the virus?<br><br>"Virus" is a Japanese "hybrid adventure" along the lines of  Snatcher, but with more developed combat. The main gameplay style is adventure: you view screens and talk to characters from first-person perspective, interacting with people and objects by selecting icons from a bar on the bottom of the screen. From time to time you'll enter 3D dungeons where you can physically move around and also encounter enemies. You fight by aiming at enemies and shooting at them in real-time. Each action costs you AP, and once your AP is depleted, you cannot perform actions until it refills gradually or until you use an AP-restoring item. You can also use shields and attack items in battles. You can buy weapons and items and use them in regular and boss battles. There are also puzzles to solve, and some major battles are also conceived as puzzles.

Description=The hero of this game is a young man who enjoys playing video games (don't we all?..). One fine day, he rents a new game; after firing it up, a princess appears on the screen, calling for help. A moment later, a demonic hand reaches to the hero and pulls him into the TV! The hero is teleported into an alternate world, a kingdom that is a mixture of medieval and modern day-like environment. This world is in danger, and only those who have the magical "voice power" can save it! The hero meets the young female magician named Whip and the princess of the country, Fret; together, they must stop the evil and figure out a way for the hero to go back to his world.<br><br>Voice Fantasia might look like an RPG, but in reality its gameplay is much closer to the adventure variety, the RPG elements reducing to a mini game-like status. Most of the gameplay here is dedicated to exploring the world, talking to characters, and acquiring and using items needed to advance the story. The infrequent turn-based battles are dictated by the story. Three girls join the party, and are able to use "voice powers", which are in effect attacks of various properties. There is no experience system of any kind.<br><br>There is also a mild "dating simulation" element in the game. The player is able to buy presents for the girls, invite them for dinner, etc. When staying at the hotel, those anime-style fantasy characters are replaced by video footage of real voice actresses. The player is able to talk to them and ask a variety of questions.

Description=Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.

Description=Winter Heat is the home conversion of the DecAthlete (also known as Athlete Kings) sequel, replacing decathlon by Winter sports. Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena). <br><br>The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:<br><br>1. Speed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.<br><br>2. Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).<br><br>3. Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.<br><br>4. Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.<br><br>5. Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.<br><br>6. Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.<br><br>7. Aerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a "click-along" version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses<br><br>8. Bobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.<br><br>9. Speed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.<br><br>10. Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.<br><br>11. Cross Country:<br> The stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.

Description=Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.<br><br>Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. <br><br>There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.<br><br>There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.

Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.

Description=Yellow Brick Road is an action adventure title inspired by the Oz Books by L. Frank Baum.  The game concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King.  Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow.  Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz.  The game is short and ends in a cliff hanger designed to lead into the next chapter, Yellow Brick Road II.  However, that game was never localized outside of Japan.<br><br>The adventure portion is kept to a minimum, primarily designed to advance the plot to the next battle without any real puzzles to speak of.<br><br>The battles are the meat of the game and they are fairly unique.  The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions.  Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game.  The more powerful items act differently depending on who uses them.  For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again.  This is important as enemies progress toward the companions side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them the battle is lost and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field the battle is won and the game progresses.  Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations and against some are immune.  Trial and error combined with quick reflexes and a good strategy of making sure not all of the characters are recuperating at the same time is the only way to succeed.

Description=Real-time strategy game with a difference: you fight for control of the sectors, some of which contains manufactories which can gain you additional units. Touch the "flag" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments and armor and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent's base... And prevent him from doing the same to you...<br><br>Z differs from other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a bit army. You have finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast you'll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle. It's these little touches that makes Z an underappreciated title, as you don't really need to micromanage each soldier.

No special packaging here, no "feelies" or other features appealing to fans and collectors (these target budget-minded new fans) -- the only thing that makes this a "collection" rather than a 2-for-1 grab from the discount bin is a cardboard sleeve that wraps around both regular-release jewel cases.

Description=A radical graphical remake of Zork: The Great Underground Empire made some 19 years after the series debut on a PDP-10 mainframe at MIT, this version boasts the incorporation of modern gameplay amenities undreamed of the first time around, such as automapping and, er, graphics.<br><br>Given ample time to drift wildly, the story and premise appear to have remained remarkably close to the source material -- the locations, layout and denizens of this fantastical subterranean treasure-hunt familiar to anyone with even a passing acquaintance with the original game.  Where the biggest change lies, of course, is in the transition from the text parser to an interface controllable by a console's joystick.  Adapting some sentence-construction conventions from the graphical adventure game genre (and the interfaces of Lucasfilm's and Legend's early entries in particular), menus selectable with a joystick pointer fill in for common "action" verbs while icons represent the inventory items the verbs influence; an expanded compass rose permits precise navigation of the Flatheadian ruins. (Alas!  No secret joystick-button combination for "xyzzy"!)<br><br>In short: as faithful a reproduction of the original experience as you're going to find without employing a keyboard or voice-recognition software, plus "modern" graphics, sound and music!
