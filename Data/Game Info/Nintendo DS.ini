Description=Bejeweled Twist is a tile matching game, where the player rotates groups of four jewels to create rows and columns of three or more matching gems. In the Classic and Zen modes, the objective is to make enough matches to fill a tube at the left side of the screen to move to the next level. There's a chain meter at the top of this tube, that builds up with matches in a row multiplying the points, and making a fruit jewel appear when full. A box at the tube bottom shows the sequence of matches needed for bonus points.<br><br>Obstacles appear randomly on the game board. The coal can't be matched, but it can be exploded by one of the power-ups gems. The locked jewel is chained to its place and can't move, but it can be removed with a match. Bomb gems display the number of moves allowed before they explode, destroying the board and ending the game. They have to be matched before their counters reach zero, otherwise a revolving wheel-of-fortune appears that stops in one of two values, skulls or gems, that either detonate or disarm the bomb. This mini-game becomes more difficult every time it comes up.<br><br>The power-ups appear after making matches of four or more gems. A four jewel match creates the flame gem, that explodes when matched removing all surrounding jewels. A five jewel match creates the lightning gem, that destroys a column and a row at the same time in a cross of fire.<br><br>With the exception of Classic Mode , the other modes are unlocked with continuous playing. Zen Mode is similar to Classic, but is more relaxed without the bomb and locked jewels. Challenge Mode is a puzzle mode, where the objective is to perform a task, like removing all gems of one color, or making a number of matches in a row. In Blitz Mode, the goal is to accumulate the maximum amount of points possible within a time limit.

Description=The world of Black Sigil is filled with magic. The magic is a part of everyday life for its inhabitants, and can be harnessed by everyone. A child born into such world without any magical abilities is considered cursed, as once such a child has grown up to be a ruthless villain  General Vai, who waged war onto the kingdom of Bel Lenora. Blade of the Exiled tells a story of a young man named Kairu - an orphan adopted and raised by a nobleman of his country. Kairu is one of the cursed children - born without magic, he is feared and ostracized by most, but despite the cruelty inflicted on him by his peers he remains optimistic and compassionate. One day his adopted father  Duke Averay informs Kairu of one last opportunity granted by Spirit Temple elders to possibly ignite Kairus magical abilities. For this he is sent to the Spirit Temple to consult the Sacred Crystal. Albeit  Kairu appears to be beyond the crystals ability to heal, and upon his return to his home city Kairu is exiled from Bel Lenora.<br><br>The game is designed to resemble a SNES-era Japanese RPG not unlike Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VI. It features standard overhead perspective for towns and dungeons, and a Mode 7-style overworld. Like in most console role-playing games of that period, the player has to gain experience by battling randomly encountered enemies which unlike newer entries in the genre do no show up on the map. The battles are fought using a top-down, pseudo-real-time system where both, the enemies and the player characters can move freely around the field, but can only execute battle commands when their turn gage fills up.

These elements remain even in single-player mode, where the player has the option of toggling their colour mid-game to produce the necessary bubble colour.)<br><br>An array of traditional power-ups (shot distance, movement speed, etc.), weapons (lightning bolts, floods and firebombs) and bonuses (freeze enemies, invincibility, flood level, etc.) remain in effect, as does the longstanding E-X-T-E-N-D bonus mechanism -- here regulated (among other effects) through subtle machinations of the new star bubble type.<br><br>When player lives are expended, the option of continuing is granted according to player performance in mini-games making use of the DS touchscreen and stylus, ramping up in difficulty through every continue used.

A secret monastic organization, Order of Ecclesia, is charged with finding alternative ways of combating the hordes of undead summoned by the ever-returning evil lord Dracula, as the Belmont clan has apparently gone into hiding. Shanoa, a young acolyte of the Order, is chosen for her extraordinary magical abilities to wield Dominus: the ultimate spell against evil. As she is about to complete the ritual to absorb Dominus a rogue acolyte named Albus steals the three tomes containing the spell. Shanoa is then dispatched to track down Albus and return him and the spell back to the Order.<br><br>Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia changes up the formula established with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night by partially reverting to the series' action game roots, introducing a series of small, mostly linear areas connected via an overworld map. Shanoa no longer has a native attack, nor can she equip a weapon; all her actions are executed via equipping glyphs (essentially souls in the previous Castlevania games). Three glyphs can be equipped, two action glyphs and a support one, allowing for great levels of player customization, as combinations of different glyphs allow Shanoa to execute devastating combos and special attacks. The game still retains its RPG leveling up system that rewards player with experience points for killing enemies, as well as the need to find HP and MP expansion capsules occasionally hidden just off the main path of the game areas. As Shanoa rescues villagers in the game's levels they will appear in the hub town and give her quests, such as hunting down rare materials or lost cats.<br><br>The multiplayer competitive race through timed courses returns from earlier DS Castlevanias, and is playable both through Wi-Fi and wireless connections.

Description=The peaceful Sulabacca island of the slime kingdom of Sulan has been invaded! All 100 of the inhabitants of the island have been kidnapped by the Shippo Dan. You alone remain to save all of the villagers from their grisly fate.<br><br>Slime MoriMori 2 has you trekking through various dungeons in search of kidnapped slimes. Your slime can hop around, float across chasms and attack using its own body as a weapon. By stretching itself and then releasing, the slime flings itself around like a rubber band, attacking enemies and ricocheting off walls. This same move is used to strike items and rescuable friends. Either the item or friend is launched into the air, so you can catch them and carry them to a safe location. The dungeons are very reminiscent of those you might see in a classically-styled 2D Legend of Zelda game filled with a variety of enemies and focusing on puzzle-solving to get through them.<br><br>In addition to this, at certain times, you must defend yourself from attack by using your Slime Tank. Battles here consist of loading your tank with ammunition that falls from chutes, and firing the ammunition to attack your opponent, or to block your opponent's fire.

Description=In Elements of Destruction the player can unleash the most volatile forces on Earth such as tornadoes, lightning storms, ice storms, earthquakes and meteor storms, wreaking havoc on unsuspecting cities and causing massive amounts of damage and creating complete and utter chaos.<br><br>The story tells of a TV weatherman by the name of Marty Storm  who is fired from his job for reporting the truth about bad weather conditions instead of lying about good weather conditions in which the station's producer hopes will result in better ratings.  Afterwards he vows revenge as his former co-workers ridicule him, unknown to them however, Marty Storm is also a part-time mad scientist that has created a device that can create disasters at will.  With this device, Storm goes on a quest to bring the city and his former co-workers to their knees.  The gameplay is divided into three weeks (levels) which have seven days, each with their own set of goals.  Some consist of causing a set amount of damage, others consist of destroying a certain percentage of building while others consist of destroying certain buildings.  These objectives must be done within a certain time limit.<br><br>To conjure these storms a menu is on the right side of the bottom screen which has a list of disasters available (some are only available on certain days).  After selecting their disaster they use the stylus pen to create a path of destruction for the tornadoes and storms or pick a certain point for either the earthquake or meteors.  For the storms and tornadoes, players can click onto them with the stylus and continue to change their path until the run out.  Additionally, the player must have a certain amount of energy to be able to select them which regenerates over time or can be obtained by destroying buildings.  To help the player, a mini-map is also located at the top of the screen which shows locations of buildings, which types of buildings they are and the buildings health status.<br><br>Each storm also has their own special attacks which are only available after they reach a level three later into the game and can be accessed by clicking an icon above the disaster.  The tornado becomes much more powerful and has the ability to cause more damage.  The lightning storm can cause fires to buildings which the player can then blow into the DS' microphone to fan the flames and spread them.  The ice storm causes a blizzard which will weaken buildings for other storms.  The earthquake will become more powerful when the player continually taps the center of the earthquake with the meteor storm has the same effect.<br><br>However there are attempts to halt the players progress which certain buildings that can instantly stop the players selected disaster.  A tornado trapper can suck up a tornado while a cloud cruncher takes out lightning and ice storms.  The seismic nullifer prevents earthquakes while the meteor shield keeps meteors from destroying buildings and the weather sucker stops both tornadoes and storms.  The storm free zone building prevents any disaster from being performed around it and a weather repeller bounces storms and tornadoes off of them.  There are also two types of drones that come in from time to time: a repairing drone will fly around and repair a building while a rebuilding drone will instantly bring a building back without any time to rebuild it.  The player can use the lightning storm to hover above these drones and destroy them.<br><br>Power-ups are also scattered throughout the level which will upgrade their storm or disaster to the next level for a brief amount of time.  To use these power-ups, the player must have their storm or disaster consume them, however the color much match the disaster that is being used, otherwise the power-up will have no effect.<br><br>There are also multiplayer modes that support up to three different players.  A race mode lets players complete a certain set of objectives given to them with the winner being the first player to complete them.  There is also a Tug-of-War where the main objective is to either have the largest amount of destruction monetary wise or through a certain percentage.

Description=Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria.  Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods.  Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of exploring it.  And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame, and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.<br><br>Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the labyrinth.  At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating various characters out of 9 different classes.  You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so strategic thinking is a must.  As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining characters have to stay in town at the guild hall.  Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it.  Movement is done one step at a time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right).  Most of the game is focused on exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply.  During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to pass obstacles in the labyrinth.  Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.<br><br>The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the necessity to draw your own maps.  The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a gridded area.  In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps.  This means not only marking where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are.  It is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map.  However, the only way to get out of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the dungeon.  Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives.  Map making is a key concept of this game because it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.

Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen.

Each tribe has its own distinct look, as well as a special ability.  Clavats can perform a special jump attack using the touch screen, Yukes can use 'Mage's Needles' to reveal hidden blocks and vines, Selkies can double jump as well as charge up a powerful arrow strike against one enemy, while Lilties can use their urns to roll over hazardous terrain, float, jump over gaps, or to create magical elements called 'Magicites'.<br><br>Each tribe can use Magicite.  These special magical elements come in different types: fire, blizzard, thunder, cure, raise and clear.  By holding the X Button, the player can use Magicite by dragging a circle out onto the game field, and positioning it over either themselves or an enemy.  The other players can place all of their circles on top of each other and release X simultaneously to 'pile' their magic and create more powerful spells.

Description=Though a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, the direct story links are few.  Luso is a young student ready for summer vacation, but forced to stay late and help the librarian Mr. Randell clean up.  Luso arrives in the library to find himself alone, but notices a strange-looking book with only half its pages filled.  It seems to leave off waiting for a name, so Luso provides his own.  All of a sudden he's transported to the other world of Ivalice.  From that point on his time is filled with exploring the world, trying to figure out what happened to him, and how he can return.<br><br>As in the other Final Fantasy Tactics titles, gameplay is centered around a grid battle between two small parties.  Characters take turns one at a time, with order and frequency determined by their speed.  In each turn they have the chance to move as well as perform a single action; not necessarily in that order.  Battles usually end by defeating the other party, though there are occasionally other goals, such as defeating the leader or examining special spots in a stage in search of an item.  As in Tactics Advance most of the battles are optional rather than necessary to complete the story.  Battles, as well as other jobs like deliveries, can be accepted at pubs in cities.  No longer do you fight other clans directly for control of areas, but annually attempt to earn control of an area through auctions.  However, jilted clans may want to have it out with you after.<br><br>In Tactics Advance, the Law system was primarily one of punishment.  If a character didn't follow the laws (Such as &quot;No magic&quot; or &quot;No ranged weapons&quot;) for a given battle, they could end up in jail.  In Tactics A2, however, laws are primarily a system of benefit.  In each battle you get to pick a stat bonus from a list you earn throughout the game.  If you break one of the laws you'll lose the bonus, and fallen characters can't be revived for the remainder of the battle (though they aren't permanently lost).  You also won't get extra loot at the conclusion of the battle.<br><br>This game retains Tactics Advance's Job and Ability system, where each race (hume, viera, moogle, nu mou, bangaa, seeq, and gria) has access to certain base classes, and abilities are earned by equipping an item and earning Job Points.  A difference is that even characters that don't take place in a battle will earn JP.  Certain later classes must be earned by having characters learn enough abilities in earlier classes, and/or completing certain quests from the pub.

It plays much like the classic 2D entries in the series, and also features a class system, disguised as the "Crown System"; a character's class is dependent on what crown he/she wears.

It might also do various other things.<br><br>The battle system is somewhat simplistic, but also unique; Action Points, or AP, play a big part in the battles. Each of the player-controlled characters has an AP meter, each topping at 5. A regular attack consumes 1 AP, and magic consumes 2 or more; this also means there are no mana points in the game. The player has the choice of either waiting a turn to gain 1 AP, or use the Boost command to gain 2 in one turn; by using the latter, the character in question cannot attack that round.<br><br>As a first in the series, the characters' appearances change depending on what weapons and armours they have equipped - as opposed to only weapons visibly changing.<br><br>The game was developed by the same team responsible for the DS remakes of  Final Fantasy III and  IV.

In it the player gets to enter the academy where he under the supervision of former Chelsea and Portugal manager Luiz Felipe Scolari gets to create his own team and test his knowledge about the sport. When starting out at the academy the player gets two packs of cards with footballers. Once the player has picked his starting eleven out of these he will be able to go to the stadium and compete against unlocked teams. Victory in matches and the player is awarded badges, trophies and better card packs that allows him to improve his team. <br><br>The player can't go directly to the stadium however. First he must prove his knowledge about game at the classroom. Here the player gets to take a Football IQ test consisting of three mini games. The accumulated points from the mini games is the player's football IQ which determines how good footballers the player can acquire. Early on the player only has access to bronze packs but by defeating teams in the stadium silver and gold packs will be unlocked. The test can be redone at any time but first it might be wise for the player to practice the mini games on the training pitch. <br><br>Once the player has a team it is time to go to the changing room and manage it. Here the player gets to pick a formation and a starting eleven. Each footballer has a number of attributes such as position, nation and skill rating. The team also has a chemistry rating which is based on the footballers' home country as well as their preferred position and formation. Therefore it's important not only to pick the best ones, but also makes sure that they fit with their team mates.<br><br>The actual matches of the game are played similarly to manager games such as Championship Manager where the player only gets to see an overview of the action. The tactical possibilities available are more limited here as the only options available are where to attack (left, right or center) and the mentality of the team (push up, sit back or balanced). What special however is that at different times throughout the matches the player will face dribbling, passing and shooting battles. Here one of the footballers will face one of the opponents. Before the battle the footballers' ratings are recalculated based on their mentality, chemistry and energy. Then each player gets to choose one of two actions and depending on if he is successful or not the footballer's rating increases or decreases. The footballer with the highest rating wins the battle. Being successful leads to more and more battles until a goal scoring opportunity appears. <br><br>Football Academy has support for two player multi-card play. The players can test out their teams against each other but it is also possible to trade footballers.

Description=Frogger: Helmet Chaos is a top-down platform game with the eighties' arcade frog as the protagonist, but now in 3d. The basic gameplay is still the game, as the frog moves one (invisible) square per key press, which maintains the feel of the original arcade game instead of the modern, smoother movement mechanics.<br><br>When Frogger climbs a tree to get some moonfruit for Toady, his friend is gone when he returns. He follows his footprints and finds out Toady is under the control of Dr. Wani, who has ordered his mini-crocs to place mind-control helmets on all residents of the land. It is up to Frogger to undo this.<br><br>The game consists of different small levels with puzzle elements. Frogger can be moved around with one square per movement, or two for a regular jump. This mechanic is most often used to navigate maze-like platforms with water. Ironically, Frogger drowns when touching liquid. While moving around he can collect coins and there are checkpoints to save progress. He can use his tongue to push or pull objects, or swing from branches. There is also a vertical jump to reach objects mid-air and he can turn 90 degrees to face a different direction. The frog has a limited amount of lives, but one can be restored by picking up an apple.<br><br>The story is continued through drawn cut-scene sequences with static images and voice-overs (on the PSP, there is only written text for the DS version). The PSP version supports game sharing, while the DS top screen shows the game statistics while playing the story mode. There are also seven mini-games, including the original arcade Frogger but with polished graphics, and hats and costumes to unlock with the collected coins.

Description=Hysteria Hospital is a Time Management game in the style of Diner Dash or Cake Mania.<br><br>You choose to play as a male or female nurse, recently graduated from the University of California, and start your career in a small medical ward in Maryville. Finding a job wasn't at all hard, and you soon find out why - you're the only nurse on call.<br><br>Gameplay is virtually identical in all platforms, being that the main differences between them come in the shape of rendered 3D visuals for the Wii and PC, while the DS sports pixel-art type 2D graphics. The music and much of the sound effects are also different between the handheld version and the others, a more bleepy old-school approach having been taken in the DS while the PC and Wii feature a more hi-definition approach. A few of the treatment machines also differ between the DS and the rest, but in the end the gameplay remains virtually the same, sporting no platform-specific mechanics.<br><br>Through a quick tutorial you learn the basics: patients must be taken to triage/diagnosis, and then different treatments will be in order using your DS stylus, Wii-mote or plain mouse.<br><br>Some patients demand more attention than others, and your limited equipment, when compared to the large and continuous flow of in-patients, means you have to juggle treatments, prescriptions and clean-up phases. An unchanged Quick Treatment bed means no other patients can use it, which can quickly lead to a high number of angry patients. If you let too many leave in wrath, then it's bye-bye money and try again (you are fired over and over, but they let you at it again since you're the only nurse available anyway).<br><br>Hysteria Hospital: Emergency Ward sports a casual atmosphere typical of Time Management games, something which is also reflected in the level of content and customisation available - add new sets of medical equipment to increase the number of patients you can treat; patients for which there is no treatment available can be sent to another center by means of an ambulance; buy items to keep in-patients happier for longer; and last but not least, change the color of your work uniform.<br><br>There isn't really much beyond this, and in the later, multi-floored levels you'll find yourself spending as much as you can in order to tend to the highest number of patients as humanly possible.<br><br>Then you become a legendary nurse.

On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset.

Each character has several different attacks of varying strengths that can be performed; some characters also have different skills that can be used to attack (such as InuYasha's wind scar or Shippo's fox magic) or help out your party (such as by restoring hit points). Each character has a limited amount of energy, and as attacks are executed the energy drains; if you run out of energy you can't attack, but a turn can be utilized to "spirit up" and recover some energy back. The more powerful an attack, the more energy it will require. If all of your characters lose all of their hit points in battle the game will be over.

Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.<br><br>The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through 8 different missions, divided in by air and by foot missions, and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through images between every mission, which use the voices of the actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.<br><br>As for the game mechanics, by foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable using the points that each mission regards you.<br><br>In the handling section, the next approach is used: move with a given set of controls, aim with another. In addition, there is also a button for repulsors (extra propulsion) to fly faster. The NDS touchscreen is used for aiming 360-wise, touching in a given direction from the center of the screen, and the pad is used for moving.

Description=Jam Sessions is a reworked and localized version of the Japan-only DS title Hiite Utaeru DS Guitar M-06. It is a rhythm/music game, but rather than only offering musical challenges like other games in the genre, it can also be used as a tool - a pocket guitar. Simulating a guitar, the game part allows players to go through a list of famous songs. The chords are selected on the D-pad while the stylus is used to simulate strumming on the screen. Alternately, the L-button can be used to strum. The details are worked out thoroughly - speed and power change the sound, and downstrokes sound different from upstrokes. With only one strum string shown, only chord progression can be performed and no individual riffing or picking. The game does not punish players for not doing well, songs just keep on going regardless of the player's performance. There is a tutorial and warm up mode to get familiar with the controls.<br><br>As a tool, it allows players to compose their own songs and add a variety of effects. These include distortion, low cut, high cut, delay, chorus and flanger with extensive settings for each of them. These can be set invariably or made touch-specific. When using headphones or external speakers, the DS microphone can be used to sing along. Additionally, the DS can be plugged in to an amplifier via the headphone jack to output a more natural sound. A US re-release include a mini-amp in the package. Instead of using a stylus, pick-shaped variants were also made available.<br><br>In the top screen, players can add a metronome, guide bars and tab guides, along with different backgrounds and templates. Up to five different compositions can be saved.

The Nintendo DS runs along similar lines, using the stylus pen to pull out and tap blocks out of place, but doesn't have the same levels as the Wii version, but does have the same kind of effects (i.e. ice blocks, cement blocks and even UFO attacks).

Description=This is the Nintendo DS release of the well-received match-3 game Jewel Match for Windows/Macintosh. Due to the limited screen size of the handheld, the grid size of the levels had to be cut down from 14x14 to 12x12 tiles, thus forcing a complete redesign of all the levels. While at it the developers added some DS-only gameplay options like the new magical storm where the player can blow into the microphone to reshuffle the jewels. <br><br>The basic idea of Jewel Match comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - the player is presented with a grid of jewels. By swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, rows of three or more identical jewels can be formed that will disappear instantly, giving points to the player and making room for other gems falling from above to take their place. The levels have gaps and shaped areas, though, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can fall diagonally.<br><br>Jewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each of the 150 levels, a selection of squares have gold or even silver backings. One match (gold) or two (silver) must be created over each of these against a ticking clock to clear the level. Later in the game there are jewels tied to their square with a golden or silver chain, which thus are not falling down and blocking empty squares beneath them. These jewels can be freed by matching them once or twice, too, which means that the most difficult squares must be matched four times (silver chain and silver background) to be cleared.<br><br>A succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a particular jewel, the second not only removes the gem but also any effects (background or chains) on the square, and the final one removes all gems of that colour. Another extra to be unlocked is a magical storm that will have the player blow into the DS microphone to mix up the jewels. Moreover, matching more than three jewels in a row will create gems with special powers. Matching four will create a joker gem while matching five gives a gem that, once activated, will destroy the whole row it is in. <br><br>The game also offers a hot seat mode where two players can play the same level right after another, competing for the better clearing time.

Description=The Legend of Zelda arrives on the Nintendo DS with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. This game starts off where the Wind Waker for the GameCube ended. Link, his friend Tetra and her gang of pirates are sailing unexplored seas when they come across a ghost ship. When Tetra wants to explore the ship she disappears and Link, who goes after her, falls into the sea and becomes stranded on an unknown island.<br><br>While remaining true to the traditional Legend of Zelda formula, this game's controls are drastically different from other Zelda titles. This time you only use the touch screen to make Link move and attack instead of buttons. For example, swinging your sword is done with a short line horizontally or vertically in front of Link, or by tapping on a specific enemy. Link can somersault forward by having the player draw a small circle on the edge of the screen while running. The boomerang can be thrown in a specific path by drawing its exact route on the touch screen.<br><br>You can also use the touch screen to make notes of secret treasures and items on the map simply by writing them down.  Sailing across the sea is also done by simply drawing the route on the map. While the route is being traveled, the player can pan the screen around to look out for enemies and other obstacles. The ship's route can also be changed while traveling if something else catches the player's attention. Later on, the player can even go fishing in the sea, using the stylus to pull the rod and reel in their catch.<br><br>The game is presented in the same cel-shaded style as the Wind Waker but it is displayed from a classic top-down perspective.

However, during the ceremony, Zelda slips Link a note warning him not to trust the Chancellor, and to help her reach the Spirit Tower.  The land's Spirit Tracks (mystical railway tracks that cover the land) have been disappearing, and she suspects that the Chancellor is the cause.  While heading to the Tower, the Chancellor intercepts them, and proves Zelda's suspicions right - he casts a magic spell on her, splitting her body from her soul!  Link and Zelda must work together to return Zelda to normal and save Hyrule once again.<br><br>In The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, the player takes on the role of Link.  As with the previous game, Phantom Hourglass, players guide Link entirely with the stylus - using it to move him, target foes, and guide special weapons.  The player is also encouraged to draw notes on the in-game maps - and in certain puzzles, it is crucial to do so.  Link receives new tools in the game as he progresses, including a windmill, which is used to blow away debris, poison gas, and enemies, and the pan flute, which is used to activate special tunes that unlock new areas, discover secrets, and more.  In certain dungeons, players will control both Link and Zelda, as they work together.  In her spirit form, Zelda is able to possess hulking Phantom suits of armour, which can be used to block flames, protect Link, and carry him across dangerous areas.<br><br>As suggested by the title, the key method of transportation involves a train.  Players draw their route to the next area on the map, and then let the train run its course.  While the train is moving, they'll need to watch out for other trains, obstacles and animals on the tracks, and enemies.  They'll also need to keep an eye on the best track route, which they can change as they near a junction.

Description=LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga for DS is a completely different game than LEGO Star Wars II for PC and consoles.  While it uses many of the same concepts, it has been rebuilt from scratch by a new team.  Like its console counterparts, it is a 3D game where you play through all six Star Wars movies using LEGO characters.<br><br>Each movie is broken into five chapters which re-create its most memorable scenes.  These are linked by 2D cutscenes.  In each chapter the player(s) control two characters, either co-operatively or by switching back and forth.  Action takes place on top screen with the lower one showing your available characters.  Characters are divided into different classes which have different special abilities.  Jedi can move things with the Force, droids can hack computers, some characters have grappling hooks, etc.  These powers must be used to solve puzzles and pass obstacles to get to the end of the levels.<br><br>Since certain characters are required to pass obstacles, many levels have alternate paths requiring you to either find a character within the level to open them or replay the level later after unlocking another character.  This gives some replayability as each level can be played several different ways.<br><br>It's not all puzzle-solving of course.  There's lots of combat as well, both in the form of waves of cannon fodder battle droids and storm troopers and boss battles.  Combat uses a mix of your basic lightsaber or blaster attacks and special abilities.  When characters die, they break into their component LEGO pieces.<br><br>There are also vehicle segments to mix up the action.  These are played from a top-down perspective and replicate things such as the pod race or the attack on the Death Star.  These sequences treat both screens as a single tall screen.

Description=Lock's Quest is a strategy / action / adventure game, for the Nintendo DS, that follows the adventurous life of a young "Archineer" named Lock (An Archineer is a mix between an architect and an engineer). Lock's village is attacked by an enemy known as the "Clockwork." During the invasion, the story is set in motion when Lock's little sister, Emi, goes missing. Lock, his new friend Isaiah, and Lock's grandfather Tobias set out in search for Emi. Along the way, Lock joins the Archineers and Kingdom Force in hopes of defeating the Clockwork army and their leader Lord Agony.<br><br>The game play consists of two main modes of play: "Build Mode" and "Battle Mode." In Build Mode, the player has a limited amount of time to build defenses that will stand up against the approaching Clockwork army. Each defensive object costs a certain amount of "Source" (the game's currency). Many levels have protection objectives that the player must defend and prevent from being destroyed by the Clockwork. The player can build walls and gates of various material types (Wood, Stone, Metal and Spiked), unique "Turrets" that automatically fire at approaching enemies, "Traps" that can be placed in the battlefield and stationary "Helpers" that give nearby turrets specific buffs. Each player can develop a personal strategy that best fits his play-style based off of the current terrain and his choice of defences. New abilities, enemies and areas are constantly unlocked as the player progresses through the entire game.<br><br>Battle Mode begins when the Build Mode timer runs out, or when the player chooses to advance to the battle. The player is thrown into a real time battle and must defend the protection objectives for a certain amount of time while holding off the attack. Other objectives include: destroying specific groups of enemies, capturing enemy objectives, rescuing friendly characters and destroying boss enemies. The battles involve controlling Lock directly with the Stylus as the enemies attack. The player may engage the Clockwork enemies in mêlée combat. Doing so brings up various mini games which can increase Lock's attack damage or add a status effect, such as poison, to the Clockwork. Lock may also repair walls and turrets which have been damaged. This also brings up a mini game where the player must use the stylus in a back and forth "ratcheting" motion to fix the wall. Not only is the player able to control Lock directly, but he can move the camera independently from the character. This control scheme allows flexibility for the player to focus on repairing or attacking in one area, while looking at what's going on in another area.<br><br>Lock's Quest is broken into 100 Build and Battle phases called "Days," covering a wide variety of areas and scenarios. The story is advanced through interactive free roam areas, villages and cinematic cut scenes which take place in between the battles. Plot twists and character development becomes the vehicle for pushing the game forward after the initial game play techniques are taught in an interactive tutorial. A multiplayer feature is also present in Lock's Quest using the wireless DS multi-card play. In this mode, two players compete head to head in a mix of Build and Battle modes where the players can choose the paths and type of clockworks their opponent will face.

The surface of this cube is divided into grid sections and some of those grid sections are coloured. There are always two grid sections coloured with one and the same colour. Goal of the game is to connect every colour pair by painting adjacent grid sections in order to create a "path" which connects the pair of coloured grid sections. The challenge here is to connect all colour pairs and the difficulty level raises with progress (e.g. more different colours and a higher grid resolution). <br><br>The goal of the fourth game is to make up a face. The game provides the player with a pre-generated make over and their goal is to reproduce it on a blank face. The player has a variety of "tools" to accomplish their goal, e.g. mascara, rouge, contact lenses, etc. <br><br>The fifth and last game within Element Girls is some sort of designer studio where the player can create their own T-shirt designs by placing a variety of shapes and using a variety of colours. After creation, these custom shirts can be applied to the custom 3D avatar.<br><br>Another central feature of the application is the association to one of the four elements (fire, earth, air or water) due to a poll.

Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies).  Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron.  Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'.  As a result, Lucian has a close combat style.  Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.<br><br>The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild.  He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes.  Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight.  Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.<br><br>The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end.  The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles.  At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called.  Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.<br><br>At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter.  To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus.  To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen.  Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.

Description=Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  <br><br>Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere.  There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.

Description=Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt is the demo version of the regular Nintendo DS title Metroid Prime: Hunters.  This version of the game, as a demo, does not contain the complete adventure, but rather features three training missions of sorts to familiarize consumers with the Nintendo DS early in the lifecycle of the system.<br><br>The game is built on the framework of the Metroid Prime titles from the GameCube and Wii, developed by Retro Studios.  In this sense, it plays from a first-person perspective for regular play, and from a 3rd person perspective when Samus transitions to Morph Ball mode.  There are five choices for controlling the game available in the Options menu, and the ability for a player to enter his or her name for recording high scores.<br><br>Since the game is little more than a Nintendo DS tech demo, features and gameplay are fairly thin, although there are four gameplay modes.<br><br>Under the Training menu, the player has three single-player options as follows:<br><br>Regulator: This mode plays the most like the regular Metroid Prime Hunters game.  The player ventures through a stage, solves a couple light puzzles, and collects a few items, and fights a generic boss.  This mode has a ten minute time limit.<br><br>Survivor:  Essentially a survival mode where the player takes on gradual waves of enemies, until eventual defeat.<br><br>Morph Ball:  Basically has the player meander through a timed maze in Morph Ball mode, all the while required to continue running through symbols on the ground.  <br><br>Multiplayer:  Exactly what it sounds like.  A two-to-four person multiplayer mode making use of the DS's Wi-Fi capabilities.  Options exist for creating new multiplayer games or joining pre-existing ones.<br><br>This title was not released for retail sale and was only put out for the purposes of demoing Metroid Prime: Hunters as well as the Nintendo DS system.

Description=The world of Ashan has a big demon problem. Every time the moon stands right, those bastards come from their prison world Sheogh and terrorize the neighborhood. This time they are searching for the Blade of Binding. Forged during the last demon war, it allows its wearer to control the demons. Something the demons of course can't allow anyone to have. So they do everything to create mistrust between the humans and the elves, unleashing a war in the Forests of Irollan. At the same time others are blinded by the gift of power the demons offer and more or less secretly join their ranks. So since the adults are bashing their heads in, it is up to their offspring to save Ashan and stop the demons.<br><br>Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is a mix of puzzle- and turn-based-strategy set in the Might & Magic universe and the story takes place 40 years before the events in Heroes of Might & Magic V. During the campaign the player takes on the role of younger versions of known heroes like the human Godric or the elf Anwen. The campaign is split into five acts, in each of which the player starts with a level 1 hero in one of the four areas of the world of Ashan and even Sheogh. Similar to the original game, the player moves his hero through the world step by step, talking to people, collecting resources like gold and stone, getting quests and fighting the various enemies around. All of this is happening in real time.<br><br>The hero has access to three types of troops: normal, elite and master, with a maximum of three normal troops, one elite and one master in his army at the same time. All of the units are taken from the Heroes of Might & Magic universe and share the same abilities as their big brothers. While the normal troops are of no concern after they have been unlocked, as they don't need to be replaced, elite and master units need to be bought at specific buildings on the map as they can be killed during combat. Combat itself is turn-based, but not on a traditional hex field like the original game. Instead, the combat is not only the main part of the game but is also designed like a puzzle game.<br><br>Once combat has started, the player has to arrange his troops by color with normally three moves available. How the troops come into the battle is solely dependent on chance. The player can only decide which troops are available to him. The two screens of the DS show the player's troops at the bottom and the enemies on the top arranged in eight rows with up to six units. If three normal units of the same color are stacked upon each other, they make a formation and get ready for combat. Elite units on the other hand need two normal units to be activated, master units four. Each unit type has a timer and a certain amount of strength associated with it. The timer tells the player in which round the unit will make their attack move. Until then the unit's strength will increase at the beginning of the player's turn until it reaches its maximum. If an enemy attack hits the same row during this charge time, the damage done by the enemy is subtracted from the strength of the unit until either the enemy's units or the unit's strength reaches zero. Inactive units also weaken the enemies attack force but much less than an attack formation. If units are formed into an attack and they have the same duration left until attack and the same color as another unit on the board, they'll link up and get even stronger. If two attack forces of the same color are formed in the same row, they will combine, more than doubling their strength.<br><br>The goal of most of the combats is to get the enemy hero down to 0 HP. This is done by successfully getting an attack formation through the enemy forces with at least one strength left. The heroes themselves are not represented on the battlefield but if their units damage the enemy hero or the hero gets hit himself, his mana will increase. Once it is full they can cast a spell like a lightning storm which is unique to that hero. Each hero and their units belong to one of the five factions including Inferno and Necropolis. The gameworld they move around in is also part of that factions home.<br><br>To spice things up, the game features boss fights which are very different to normal fights, as well as other story-relevant battles that differ from the standard &quot;Kill the Hero&quot; format. Godric for example has to free some prisoners by hitting two switches at the same time with his attack groups. Also available are combat puzzles where the goal is to wipe out the enemy troops in just one turn with pre-defined units.

Description='Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan' is a music-based rhythm game on the Nintendo DS. The premise revolves around a troupe of men dressed in black uniforms that act as a "Cheersquad" (or 'Ouendan'). Their job: Aid anyone who is in need of motivation whenever they cry out "OUENDAN!!!" When the cry is heard, these guys appear and dance to music in order to motivate the person to finish his or her task. <br><br>The Cheersquad's success depends on how well the player does. The game takes advantage of the system's touch screen by having players tap circles in time with the beat of the music. Other actions include tapping a stack of circles repeatedly, following a moving ball along a path by dragging the stylus on it, and spinning a wheel. Each successful action fills a power bar at the top of the touch screen and contributes to the score. This bar drains continuously and will take large hits if the player misses a beat or two. If the bar hits zero, the game is over.  <br><br>Ouendan contains 15 licensed songs with a level dedicated to each, and the songs are drawn from popular Japanese Rock. There are also 4 difficulty levels, 2 of which have to be unlocked through play. Each difficulty level alters the number of circles that need to be tapped, paths to trace, and wheels to spin. The timing of each is also changed, with easier difficulties giving more time to anticipate when to tap, while harder difficulties speed this up. A multiplayer mode is also featured, as well as a download & play option that sends the tutorial level to DS's that don't have the game.

Each grid already contains a few numbers, how many depends on the level of difficulty.

It is possible to ask for hints, but these cost "coins" that have to be earned by solving puzzles. Hint A gives some possible numbers for the current cell, Hint B provides the correct number for the current cell, and Hint C scans the whole board and marks cells as right or wrong.

Description=Polar Bowler is a bowling game. But no ordinary, the game uses an Arctic theme (more or less). Furthermore, there is not even a ball in the game.<br><br>First off, the game offers two different game modes, Straight Bowling and Power Bowling. Furthermore there are 7 different lanes and 6 different characters in the game, so you can play an Ice bear, a Penguin, a Snowman, or even Santa Claus. But the game starts only with one lane and one character.<br><br>Straight Bowling acts much like the classic bowling. You have the ten pins and your character, which is the games substitute for your ball, and you must smash as many pins as possible in order to get a good score (and to win the game when you are not playing alone). You start your ride by positioning your character at the beginning where you want him to slide from. In contrary to a real bowling, you cant throw the ball diagonal, but thats not needed too. Once your ride has started, you can move your character left and right and change his destination. You can even slide a curve, if youre good. If not, the physic do their job. You can even control how fast you slide, but that only at the beginning of the ride. Their, you can choose the speed by tighten the line you use to throw you into the lane.<br><br>Power Bowling sets on top of this. Here the game gets spiced up by Power Ups. After you positioned your character and tightened your line, at that time you cant change your position anymore, Power Ups appear on the lane. Once you collect them, they work in this throw, and this throw only, once you return to the start, their bonuses will be reset. So you must collect them, and use them immediately (will be automatically used, when the character impacts on the pins). There are two different types of Power Ups, one that affect your character, and one that affects your score.<br><br>The following Power Ups are possible to find: Bomb (doubles the power of the character; at the impact it will smash more pins then regular), Zap (will send an electrical discharge out on impact with the pins, which will smash much more then the bomb), Vapor (will vaporize all pins on impact; will result in a strike even when you only touch one of the pins at the far sides), Multiplier (will multiply the amount of pins you smash with the type you collected for your total score), Multiplier can be found as 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x. Smashing 5 pins with a multiplier of 3x will result in 5 regular points and 10 power points.<br><br>The basic scoring is on both game modes the same, it is also the same like regular bowling rules. In Power Bowling mode, once you finished the game, the amount of power points you gathered, will be added to the regular points, and so both of them will determine your final score. So, with many strikes you can get awesome scores.<br><br>Every time you reach 200 points on a single lane, you unlock a new lane or a new character.<br><br>And like a real bowling game, the game can be a multiplayer game, were up to four player can participate, playing on the same computer in Hotseat mode.

Description=This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white).  To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.  You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.<br><br>There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical.  Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern on the screen.  The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same.  But the trick is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus.  There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very difficult.<br><br>The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer.  Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks and your opponent's blocks.  As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled and sent to your adversary.  The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does.  The multiplayer mode does not require 2 Game Cards to play.  In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they don't even need to play multiplayer.  The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by themselves.

Description=Don't let the "2010 Edition" fool you - this is based off of the original version of the popular 80's game show Press Your Luck. The garish 1980s set and the flow of the show have both been faithfully replicated in digital form. The game features a single player mode, where the contestant plays through 20 shows of different opponents and increasing difficulty. Alternatively, up to three players can play an episode as contestants in the game's "Party Mode."<br><br>Gameplay mirrors the game show it is based on. There are two rounds, each with a question phase and a board phase. Players are asked four multiple-choice questions in the question phase. Ringing in first and giving the correct answer nets you 3 spins. The other two players then get a chance to pick their answer to earn 1 spin. Incorrect answers gain no spins.<br><br>In the board phase, players use their accumulated spins to rack up cash. The board "spins" at random until the player hits a button to stop the cycle, earning whatever cash on the space the board stopped on. If the board stops on a cartoon "Whammy," that contestant's score is set to zero. Four Whammies removes that contestant from the game. The idea is to "press your luck" as long as you can, and then dump remaining spins off on another player in hopes of forcing them into a Whammy.<br><br>As players win games, they unlock new costumes and hairstyles for their avatar.

While she was away, a wicked witch trapped the castle residents inside mirrors, shattered the glass and scattered the pieces. With the help of a fairy, the princess must rescue her people and restore the place to finally marry Prince Adam.<br><br>Princess Isabella: A Witch's Curse is a hidden object game with adventure elements. The main objective is to collect several key objects from the castle grounds, to solve puzzles and free the castle folk. The castle can be explored in a typical point-and-click manner, where each location is represented by an static image of the scenery, and the player moves from room to room by clicking on the exit hotspots, usually placed over obvious and logical areas like doors and entrances. Some portions of the building are locked, and can only be accessed after solving one of the puzzles.<br><br>The objects can be found laying around in the background, or in some separate close-up views of the scenery. These zoom windows show another angle of the scene, with a list of objects to be found and collected at the bottom. Some of the collected items are stored in the inventory slots, from where they can be dragged and dropped on puzzles and other portions of the screen to interact with the environment. Mirror shards have to be inserted in one of the empty frames at the grand hall, and reassembled as jigsaw puzzles to liberate one of the captive souls. The rescued character usually unlocks a castle passage as a reward.<br><br>Each room has several puzzles that have to be solved to lift the curse and move to the next place. Some of the puzzles are self-contained mechanisms that can be solved through direct manipulation. Others block access to other parts of the castle, and require the use of inventory objects. After solving all the pending puzzles, the room is restored to its pristine condition.<br><br>One unique feature is the fairy assistant. She is the hint button, flying towards one of the required items when selected, and can also perform a series of special actions. She gradually learns new abilities that can be used to reveal hidden objects and solve puzzles. With the rock ability, she can break small containers like bottles and vases. The flame ability can be used to light something on fire, or attack an enemy. The wind ability blows away dust and other deposits, often revealing some obscured item. The water ability can be used to nourish plants. The hint option take some time to recharge after use, and becomes a skip option when playing one of the puzzles.

Description=Prism: Light the Way is a cutesy puzzle game set inside a black hole. It is based on the conceit that black holes are the natural habitat of quantum beings called Glowbos that feed on light. When the light is blocked by a space monster, the Glowbos risk starvation until a race of light-emitting creatures called Bulboids (effectively controlled by the player) arrive to save them.<br><br>The basic principle of the game is to bend rays of light (which always travel at right angles) so that they hit colour-coded targets at the edge of the playing area (an 8x8 grid). To achieve this the player can move any of the pieces (Bulboids, mirrors, coloured filters, prisms, etc.) on the grid. Pieces can be dragged to any free space on the board (so you dont have to shuffle pieces about as you would with a sliding tile puzzle) but cannot be rotated.<br><br>The game features a time attack arcade mode (where the player must clear randomly-generated levels to earn extra time), a free play mode which removes the timer, a puzzle mode where the player must complete increasingly difficult handmade levels, and (in the PC version only) a fast-paced shooting gallery mode where targets and playing pieces are dropped onto the board intermittently, and the player must constantly rearrange the pieces to hit all the targets before they go critical.

Description=Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity is a puzzle game similar to the Incredible Machine series. During the 100 levels the goal is always to press a button. To achieve this goal the player has a selection of items to his disposal - nothing fancier than boards or balls - to build a construction of chain reactions. When he starts the experiment, a ball (in seldom cases a vehicle) gets released to set the thing in motion. An innovation compared to similar games is that the physics simulation doesn't get disabled during the building phase. This means the player can destroy his constructions when being careless during placing another item. There is also a help functions which gives hints to the correct solution.<br><br>By beating levels the player unlocks so-called sandbox levels where he can freely experiment with the physics engine. Mini games, e.g. building a tower which has to withstand an earthquake, can be played against other players. There are a small differences between the versions: the PC version offers an editor to build own experiments and the DS version offers fewer sandbox levels and mini games.

The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.<br><br>The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the  combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.<br><br>The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.<br><br>New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges.

However, Puzzle Quest is an RPG with a twist. Everything is done (as the name implies) with puzzles.<br><br>Everything in Puzzle Quest is done with puzzles. The puzzles themselves are similar to Bejeweled in execution, with a few slight variations used for things like item crafting and enemy capture.<br><br>When fighting an enemy (which can range from zombies to orcs and even castle strongholds, each with their own special spells and abilities), you both take turns using the same board. The goal is to reduce your opponents hitpoints to zero, which can be done directly by linking up skulls in rows of three or more, or by using spells which require mana. To build up mana, just link three or more runes of the same color together, just like the skulls. Every time you gain mana, it's stored in your reserves until you use it (or are hit with a mana draining attack). Gold and experience are built up in the same way, using gold coins or purple experience orbs that occupy the same board and can be linked just like runes and skulls.<br><br>The real strategy behind the game comes into play when you factor in elemental mastery (gaining extra mana when linking runes for a specific element), equipment (which can prevent damage, drain mana and more), spells (which can poison, drain mana, stun and so on) and linking up groups of four or more. The reason groups of four are important is that every time a row of four-of-a-kind is created, you get an extra turn. While it doesn't sound important, getting four runes in a row could possibly give you enough mana to cast an extremely powerful spell and give you the extra turn to cast it before your enemy can even move.<br><br>There is also a direct action mode in which players can hone their skills against various opponents independent from the story mode, as well as wireless multi-card play where two players can square off using their own characters from the campaign mode.

Description=Puzzle Quest: Galactrix is, just like its predecessor, a mix of many different genres. At its core there is a Bejeweled-style match-3 puzzle game. In Galactrix, the gems the player has to match have been changed to hexagon shapes, making diagonal matches possible. Also, new gems are filled in from whatever side the player last removed a gem, making the gameplay even more complex.<br><br>The game's back story is this time set in the future, and the player has a large galaxy map to explore. In each star system, there are a number of planets, asteroids, leap gates and space stations. The player has to accept missions which further the background story, but they can also choose to do side quests like mining for raw materials that can be sold for varying prices in each solar system.<br><br>During the course of the game, the player can pick up several side characters which bring along with them mini games, like constructing devices for the player's ships or hacking leap gates to access new areas on the map. The core gameplay revolves around battling other space ships though. Successful battles will result in more intel (the equivalent of experience points), which in turn helps leveling up the player's hero, increasing their stats.

The cab is rigged with cameras and the driver acts as the quiz master. The candidates have time to answer questions and win money until they reach their destination. After three wrong answers, however, the ride ends prematurely and they have to look for another cab. To make things a little easier two jokers are available. The candidates can either make a phone call or ask the driver to stop and ask a random pedestrian for help.<br><br>The Nintendo DS game works almost exactly like the TV show. There are different cities and routes to choose from. Completing all routes in a city will unlock the next city. This does not really influence the game, however, as the taxi travelling to its destination simply acts as a time limit for the quiz game. The quiz itself is a simple multiple choice dialog with three possible answers for each question. Just like in the TV show the player can use jokers to get answers to more difficult questions - and just like in real life these answers are not always correct. At random points the taxi may have to stop at a red light and this gives the player the chance to win back a joker by winning a mini game like Memory, Hot Wire or a spelling game.<br><br>There are also two wireless multiplayer modes. In "Team Mode" up to three player vote on a team answer and win or lose together. In "Combat Mode" up to three players ride separate taxis and try to win the most money within the time limit.

Description=Scribblenauts is a side-scrolling action game based on puzzles. The goal is to have the character Maxwell overcome obstacles by summoning objects based on a dictionary of more than 20.000 words, partly based on the concept of the real-life game Mad Libs. This is done by writing an object's name on the touchscreen, letter by letter. When the word is recognized, the object spawns in the world, where it can be manipulated or act on its own. This leads to an endless amount of possibilities to progress through the game. For instance, when an item needs to be retrieved from a tree, you could summon a ladder to get it out, a football to hit it, or just a helicopter or an albatross to fly over there. There are also more bizarre examples, such as summoning a time machine, going back in time to fetch a dinosaur egg, make it hatch and then use it in the future to defeat an army of robot zombies. The list also includes weapons, historical people, and even references to popular cultures and internet memes. Profanity and trademarked objects are not recognized. There is also a spelling checker included to offer suggestions.<br><br>This game is a logical sequel to the gameplay mechanics of Drawn to Life, an earlier title by 5TH Cell, relying on the same concept of emergent gameplay, where the actual game is more of a toolbox, shaped through the player's interaction and different in each session. During the game Maxwell needs to collect starites. To do this, two to four objects are often summoned at the same time. There are general, slow puzzle levels, but also faster action levels filled with enemies, platforms, switches and traps. Often, the summoned objects and characters need to interact with each other. Players can earn "merits" for not using weapons in a level for instance and finding a more creative approach. When a level is completed, a silver star is awarded and the Free Play mode for the level is unlocked. When the level is then completed three more times, using a different approach each time, a gold star is provided.<br><br>By solving puzzles, Ollars are awarded, the game's currency. It can be exchanged for different avatars or visual changes. The game includes a level editor and support for Wi-Fi to share the levels.

Additionally, if in-game "Help" is enabled, pressing a button in the bottom right corner reveals the location of all on-screen items Nina can investigate - removing the need for mindless pixel-hunting.

Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.<br><br>Exhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.<br><br>Version differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.<br><br>Each character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. <br><br>Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.

Description=In the beginning of 21st century, an atomic explosion in the South Pole caused a strange, unseen phenomenon: a black hole appeared and started spreading, threatening to swallow the Earth. It was named Schwarzwelt, or "black world". The United Nations send a team of four trained specialists from different countries to venture inside the Schwarzwelt. The protagonist is an unnamed North American (Japanese, in the original Japanese release) soldier. Upon arriving into the Schwarzwelt, the team finds out that demons have entered the Earth...<br><br>Strange Journey is in many ways "return to the roots" of  Megaten games, particularly to the  first Shin Megami Tensei. The gameplay system is very similar to that original template: it is a first-person dungeon crawler, which retains all the basic ingredients of a traditional Shin Megami Tensei title. The focus of the gameplay is on fighting, negotiating, and eventually and recruiting regular enemies (demons), summoning them afterwards as controllable characters within the player's party. As in classic Megaten games, it is possible to fuse demons to create more powerful ones. The game retains the Law-Neutral-Chaos axis, usage of guns during the turn-based combat, spell names, and other characteristic elements of the franchise. Unlike other games in the main  Shin Megami Tensei series, Strange Journey has automatic leveling up.

Description=Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix of fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.<br><br>The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:<br><br>1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.<br><br>2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.<br><br>3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.<br><br>4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.<br><br>5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.<br><br>Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions.

Description=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack is a modern take on the original Turtles arcade game. Just like TMNT: Smash Up on the Wii this game was also released to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary and likewise also uses the original black and white style comic panels to move the story forward.<br><br>Unlike Konami's Turtle beat 'em ups, Arcade Attack is in fact 3D while attempting to play as though it were 2D but with a slightly isometric camera angle. The game can be played alone with a CPU ally or with a friend wirelessly with a selection of the four turtles, each with their own varying stats. Also much like Smash Up, while the game tries to blend both the new and the old TMNT universe all into one it leans a lot more heavily toward the new with its visual style and enemy selection.

Description=At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.<br><br>Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games.  A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda.  Remixes of music from these games are also used.<br><br>Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.<br><br>Push mode is a versus game with a twist.  The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center.  Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area.  Push back and forth until one side loses.<br><br>Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos.  The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.<br><br>Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces.  You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.<br><br>Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L piece".  Finish the mission and you'll be given another.  Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.<br><br>Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control.  Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos.  The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small.  Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.<br><br>Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS.  Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score.  Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies.  Push mode remains a one-on-one experience.  With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.

This time the evil scheme is about information warfare and tries to drive America, South Korea and China into a war...<br><br>Even if the basic premise of every level is similar the actual design is different and more linear than in the console/PC version. Also one of the seven levels is completely new. Another big change are the controls: walking, fighting and performing acrobatic tricks use the control pad and buttons. But for moving the camera the player has to use the touch screen - which practically means he can't do both at the same time. He also activates his gadgets, e.g. night vision, there. The lockpicking mini game uses the stylus.<br><br>The game also features two multiplayer modes: in Versus (seven maps) the players choose between spy and soldier - the former have to hack computers, the others have to prevent that. In Cooperation two players solve five co-op levels in which one plays a soldier and the other a hacker.

Now, with the aid of her robotic butler Cromwell and her short but helpful assistant Funghi, she sets out to earn her reputation as the Touch Detective.  She'll chase down a stolen dream, search for a missing person, and more, as she attempts to become well known for her detecting skills.<br><br>Touch Detective is an adventure game in the style of later Sierra adventure games such as Space Quest 6.  Players navigate Mackenzie through various screens by touching the area where they want her to move.  Mackenzie can interact with certain on-screen objects with another tap of the stylus - depending on the object, she may look at it, pick it up, talk to it (if it can strike up a conversation), or even touch it to see what it feels like.  Mackenzie likes to feel objects to understand them, which is why she's the 'Touch' Detective.  Mackenzie can also check and combine objects in her inventory.<br><br>The top screen of the DS always has a close-up of Mackenzie herself.  As she talks to other characters, observes objects and so forth, the top screen will display Mackenzie's thoughts - so while she may say one thing to a person ("Sure, I get it..."), she'll be thinking another ("What was that?  I wasn't listening!").

After the first case is completed, players can also choose to take on the Bonus Case.  In this case, there is no main story, but Mackenzie can choose to take on small requests from characters, as well as increase her Touch List, which records the feeling of particular objects in the game world.

Description=Wickie und die Starken Männer (Vicky the Viking) is based on a German / Japanese cartoon TV series of the same name. The show premiered in Germany in 1974, a live action adaptation by German director and comedian Micheal "Bully" Herbig followed in 2009. The DS game was released in the wake of the new movie remake, but is nevertheless based on the original animated series.<br><br>Wickie is a young Viking boy of about 10 years of age. He is more clever and sharp-witted than anyone else in his home village of Flake and thus often saves the day. In this game the men of Flake have been captured while on a mission; once again it is up to Wickie to come up with a rescue plan.<br>The game is a classic platform game. Wickie carries a slingshot, but that is not enough to defeat the more powerful enemies. Instead, he must rely on tricks and traps such as pushing boulders towards enemy patrols. There are five different game worlds that lead Wickie into different corners of Europe. Short cut scenes with the characters from the animated series tell the story in-between the levels. There are also some very simple mini games such as lock picking or connect the numbers.

In the final levels of each stage, the goal is to collect a glass shard by creating a square/rectangle around it. Creating a set of twelve or more tiles gives a time boost, while making a sequence of squares with the same tile type removes it from the board.<br><br>Special tiles appear randomly on the board and give power-ups when collected. The Goldmin is a smiling gold square that can be used as a vertices tile for any combination, and gives extra time when collected. The Badmin is a black and spiky shape with an evil smile that shuffles all the other tiles. The Bigmin is a giant blue squiggly shape with a worried expression, taking the space of nine tiles. The Wingmin is an angry and red star-shaped tile with wings, that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the grid. The Plusmin is a smiling and cross-shaped yellow tile, that can remove a cross of tiles. The Bossmin is similar to the Badmin, a big and black mustached tile that takes the place of nine tiles and shuffles the whole grid.<br><br>The Windows version has two modes. In the Adventure Mode, a story is told between levels by cutscenes, describing a quest to recover the broken pieces of a stained glass shrine. There's no plot in the Endless Mode, only a succession of levels of increasing difficulty.<br><br>The Xbox 360 version also includes a Battle Mode which can be played online or locally, along with the Endless Mode. Adventure Mode is available as an additional download.

Description=Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2007 is based on the anime <br>Yu-Gi-Oh! and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX but there is no real plot in this game. It is a simulated environment to play the Yu-Gi-Oh! collectible card game. Play vs. the AI in regular, limited, and themed battle, or challenge the various puzzles where you must win in one turn with the cards given to you. In addition to playing against the game AI, you can challenge other players online through the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection. The game allows you to change the appearance of your avatar through various hair, shirt, and VR disc styles. Earn points by winning battles; the points act as currency and allow you to purchase small booster packs increasing the size of your card library.<br><br>Yu-Gi-Oh! is a collectible card game where two players battle by using monster, trap, and spell cards.  The rules have changed over time, but in this game both players start with 8,000 life points.  There are many ways to win, the most common through damage, which brings your opponent's life points to 0.  If you're not able to draw a card you lose. Also, there are certain cards that give you special win conditions. The field is restricted though to only allow 5 trap and/or spell cards and 5 monster cards.  Deck size is a minimum of 40 cards.<br> <br>Each player takes turns that are broken down into phases (draw, standby, main, battle, main 2, and end phase). The main actions take place during the two main phases and the battle phase. To begin, the players draw 5 cards. Each player draws a card during their own draw phase. Some cards have special effects that occur during the standby phase; otherwise, nothing happens during this phase, although some cards can be activated during this time as well. The main phases allow the current player to make any number of special summons, set any number of trap cards, play or set any number of spell cards and make one tribute, normal, or set summon.<br><br>During the battle phase each player can attack with any of their face up attack position monsters on the field, but this phase is skipped for the player that goes first. The end phase is a clean up phase and a time for any last minute actions. If the current player has more than six cards in hand, then they must discard down to six cards.

Description=Zendoku takes the concept of the puzzle game Sudoku and adds role playing elements to it.<br><br>The game replaces the numbers 1 to 9 with nine Martial Arts symbols like a panda or a dragon but the original rules remain in place. This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode. <br><br>At the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol. Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the panda as his lucky symbol. Once a decision has been made. the player follows the story line of the chosen character on a 2D world map and when a fight occurs, the opponents play a round of Sudoku.<br><br>Every time one of the fighters completes a column, row or 3x3 box an attack is launched and obstacles appear on the opponents board while an attack icon travels along a rail towards the attacked. If he now correctly places his lucky symbol on the board, the attack will be reversed back his opponent. Placing a symbol incorrectly will make the player lose health and causes several cells on the opponent's grid to automatically fill in.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode for two player in which they can either try to solve a puzzle together or play against each other in a battle.
