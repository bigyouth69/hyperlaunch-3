Additionally, matches are 1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for longer rounds than usual.

This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.<br><br>The King of Fighters 2000 features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year's tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the "alternate" striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami's alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden "maniac" striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.

Description=In this eighth installment of the King of Fighters series, ten different teams once again battle it out in several countries to decide which team will be this year's King of Fighters. However, the NESTS organization is once again standing in the participant's way; they have deployed their own team of four fighters, lead by two individuals of high-rank within NESTS: a man claiming to be the original Zero and Igniz, the CEO of NESTS.<br><br>The character roster has been updated yet again for this release in the series. Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), The King of Fighters 2001 has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.

Description=The tenth installment in SNK's long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game's storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...<br><br>This year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF '02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).<br><br>Like The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF '94 to KOF '98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.

Each team consists of three fighters for each player, the winner being the player who is able to eliminate the other team first. Each active character can charge up "Art of Fighting" style in order to gain access to "Desperation Moves", or "DMs" (moves which operate very much like Street Fighter's Super Combos).

In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain "Edit Team" combinations are selected.<br><br>As of The King of Fighters '97, you can play in either the Extra or Advanced game modes. Extra Mode is the typical AOF/KOF scheme, in which your power gauge fills up as you defend yourself or charge yourself up. The new Advanced Mode, on the other hand, only allows you to charge your gauge as you perform special moves and attacks, similar to the Street Fighter series. Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll past and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent "Super Desperation Move" (or SDM) at any time provided the character has at least two full bars of charged energy stored. In contrast, SDMs can only be performed in Extra when a character has less than a quarter of their health left.<br><br>New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of "Blue" Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki.

The game puts you in control of a team of 3 characters (with you controlling the lead character or the one with the ball at the time) that must defeat a selection of other teams in order to become the champion. This time around the teams are all formed by characters from the Nekketsu Kunio Kun universe, each representing different suburbs of Tokyo that compete in an amusement park for the ultimate title.<br><br>You can mix and match characters from the different teams (and even edit the team as you advance in the tournament, by adding defeated characters to the roster). Each character has their unique stats and special moves, which now depend on a power bar that can be charged-up by holding both attack buttons.<br><br>The most important difference in this game and the rest of the series is the new graphical look courtesy of the Neo Geo hardware.

Digitized samples are used to provide in-game voices and taunts, and the entire interface and general design of the game has been jazzed up to resemble more of a big-time SNK fighting game.
